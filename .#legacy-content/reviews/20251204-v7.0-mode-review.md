# v7.0 Mode Structure & Content Review (2025-12-04)

This report summarizes the findings from an inspection of the `v7.0/modes` directory structure and content as of 2025-12-04.

## 1. Structural & Naming Issues

Based on the `list_files` output and the structure definition (`v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`):

*   **Hierarchy Folder Naming:**
    *   The top-level hierarchy folders currently use `00x-executive`, `01x-director`, `02x-lead`, `04x-assistant`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Rename these to `000-executive`, `010-director`, `020-lead`, `040-assistant` respectively, to strictly match the v7 hierarchy definition. The `03x-worker` folder is correctly named.
*   **Mode Filename Inconsistencies:**
    *   `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/angular-developer/031_angular-developer.mode.md`: Uses an underscore. **Recommendation:** Rename to `031-work-fe-angular-developer.mode.md`.
    *   `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/animejs-specialist/031_animejs-specialist.mode.md`: Uses an underscore. **Recommendation:** Rename to `031-work-fe-animejs-specialist.mode.md`.
    *   **Action:** A systematic check of all filenames against the `[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md` convention is needed.
*   **Extraneous Directory:**
    *   An `md/` directory was listed within `v7.0/modes/`. Its purpose is unclear.
    *   **Recommendation:** Investigate and remove this directory if it's not intentional.
*   **`gcp-architect` Placement:**
    *   This mode was correctly moved to `v7.0/modes/020-lead/devops/gcp-architect/` and renamed `020-lead-do-gcp-architect.mode.md` based on its internal definition, resolving the previous discrepancy.

## 2. Mode Completeness & Consistency Analysis (Based on Sampling)

*   **Executive Level (`roo-commander`):**
    *   Appears very complete and detailed, including comprehensive custom instructions and metadata.
    *   Requires parent folder rename (`00x` -> `000`).
*   **Director Level (`technical-architect`, `product-manager`):**
    *   `technical-architect` is well-defined with detailed workflow guidance.
    *   `product-manager` (newly added) likely needs review for completeness.
    *   Requires parent folder rename (`01x` -> `010`).
    *   **Issue:** Optional sections (Safety Protocols, Knowledge Base) noted as missing in `technical-architect` based on v6.3 source. Need decision on including these for v7.0.
*   **Lead Level (All 6 newly created):**
    *   Sampled `frontend-lead`. Assumed all 6 are basic templates.
    *   **Major Gap:** These modes require significant content creation: Detailed Capabilities, Custom Instructions (Workflow steps, Collaboration, Error Handling, etc.), full Metadata (Tool Groups, Stack, Delegation/Escalation lists, API Config).
    *   Requires parent folder rename (`02x` -> `020`).
*   **Worker Level (`react-specialist`, various others):**
    *   Sampled `react-specialist`. Appears very complete, including detailed instructions and knowledge base section.
    *   **Issue:** API Configuration (`quasar-alpha`) differs from other sampled modes (`gemini-2.5-pro`). Needs standardization decision.
    *   **Issue:** Knowledge Base source file reference needs verification/process definition.
    *   **Assumption:** Modes converted from v6.3 are likely mostly complete but need review for consistency (API config, optional sections, delegation lists). Newly added workers (e.g., `ant-design-specialist`, `jquery-specialist`, `directus-specialist`, etc.) likely require more thorough review for completeness.
    *   Filename inconsistencies noted above (`angular`, `animejs`).
*   **Assistant Level (`context-resolver`, others):**
    *   Sampled `context-resolver`. Appears mostly complete and well-defined for its specific role.
    *   Requires parent folder rename (`04x` -> `040`).
    *   Newly added assistants (`crawl4ai-specialist`, `firecrawl-specialist`) need review for completeness.
*   **Cross-Cutting Issues:**
    *   **API Configuration:** Inconsistent models specified (`gemini-2.5-pro` vs. `quasar-alpha`). **Recommendation:** Standardize the default model or document the rationale for variations.
    *   **Optional Sections:** Sections like "Key Considerations / Safety Protocols" and "Context / Knowledge Base" are present in some detailed modes but missing/noted as undefined in others. **Recommendation:** Decide on a standard set of sections for v7.0 modes and ensure they are consistently present (even if empty initially).
    *   **Delegation/Escalation Lists:** All modes with these lists need verification against the final v7.0 mode set and naming conventions.

## 3. Potential Missing Modes

Based on the current structure and common development needs:

*   **Cloud Architects:** We have `gcp-architect` (as a Lead). Consider adding `aws-architect` and `azure-architect` at the same `020-lead-devops` level for parity if multi-cloud projects are anticipated.
*   **Security Lead (`020-lead-security`):** The hierarchy document doesn't explicitly list this, but `gcp-architect` escalates to a `security-lead`. A dedicated Lead for coordinating security workers (`security-specialist`) might be beneficial. Currently, `security-specialist` is under `039-cross-functional`.
*   **Authentication/Authorization Lead:** Depending on complexity, a dedicated Lead coordinating modes like `clerk-auth-specialist` might be useful, or this could fall under Backend/Frontend Leads.
*   **AI/ML Lead/Workers:** If AI/ML development is a focus, dedicated Lead/Worker modes might be needed beyond the current Assistants.
*   **Mobile Development Lead/Workers:** No specific mobile development department exists. If native mobile apps are planned, consider adding `020-lead-mobile` and relevant workers (e.g., `ios-swift-developer`, `android-kotlin-developer`, `react-native-specialist`).

## 4. Workflow Overview

*   **Hierarchy:** The defined levels (Exec -> Director -> Lead -> Worker) establish a clear delegation path. Assistants support all levels.
*   **Coordination:** `roo-commander` acts as the central coordinator, initiating tasks and managing overall flow. Directors manage broad phases/areas. Leads manage specific technical departments. Workers execute tasks.
*   **MDTM:** The Markdown-Driven Task Management workflow is referenced in `roo-commander` and `technical-architect` for complex/critical tasks, involving dedicated task files in `project_journal/tasks/`. This seems appropriate for maintaining state and clarity in complex delegations.
*   **Collaboration:** Modes define `Delegates To`, `Escalates To`, and `Reports To` metadata, crucial for understanding interaction patterns. These need careful review for accuracy across the entire v7.0 set.

## 5. Summary & Discussion Points

*   **Immediate Actions:**
    1.  Rename top-level hierarchy folders (`00x` -> `000`, etc.).
    2.  Correct inconsistent filenames (`angular`, `animejs`).
    3.  Investigate and remove the `v7.0/modes/md/` directory.
*   **Content Gaps:**
    1.  Prioritize completing the six Lead mode templates.
    2.  Review newly added Worker/Assistant modes for completeness.
    3.  Review converted Worker modes for consistency.
*   **Decisions Needed:**
    1.  Standardize API Configuration (`model`) across modes?
    2.  Define and standardize optional sections (Safety Protocols, Knowledge Base)?
    3.  Verify/update all Delegation/Escalation/Reporting lists?
    4.  Establish process for Knowledge Base source files?
    5.  Consider adding potentially missing modes (Cloud Architects, Security Lead, Mobile, AI/ML)?
*   **General:** The v7.0 structure provides a solid foundation. Addressing the inconsistencies and completing the mode definitions, especially for the Leads, is the next critical step.

This report provides a starting point for refining the v7.0 mode set. Further detailed review of each mode file will be necessary to ensure full consistency and completeness.
