# Roo Commander v5.2 Project Plan

**Version:** 5.2
**Date:** 2025-04-05
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Goal

This plan outlines the phases and high-level tasks required to implement the core concepts for Roo Commander v5.2: User Personas, Flexible Workflow, and Proactive Intent Analysis. The aim is to make Roo Commander more adaptive, intuitive, and efficient for a wider range of user workflows.

## 3. Phases & High-Level Tasks

### Phase 1: Design & Refinement

*Goal: Solidify the technical design and user experience for the new features.*

*   **Task 1.1:** Refine Persona Definitions & Mode Mapping
    *   *Description:* Review and finalize the defined personas. Map specific modes and suggested workflows to each persona. Define how personas might be identified or selected.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Technical Architect, Project Manager
*   **Task 1.2:** Design Flexible Workflow State Transitions & UI/UX
    *   *Description:* Detail the mechanisms for mode switching, context passing between modes, and how the `project_journal` supports workflow persistence. Design any necessary UI elements for workflow guidance.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* UI Designer, Technical Architect
*   **Task 1.3:** Design Proactive Intent Logic & Confidence Scoring
    *   *Description:* Specify the algorithms or heuristics for analyzing user input, determining intent confidence, and generating relevant mode/action suggestions (Paths A-E).
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Technical Architect
*   **Task 1.4:** Define `project_journal` Schema Updates
    *   *Description:* Specify changes or additions to the `project_journal` structure needed to store workflow state, context, decisions, and potentially persona information.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Technical Architect, Database Specialist (if applicable)
*   **Task 1.5:** Design Optional User Profile Mechanism
    *   *Description:* Design the flow and storage for the optional user detail gathering feature mentioned in the Proactive Intent document.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Technical Architect, UI Designer

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

*Goal: Build the foundational backend and frontend components for the new features.*

*   **Task 2.1:** Implement Persona Identification/Selection Logic
    *   *Description:* Implement the core logic within Roo Commander to identify or allow selection of user personas.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Code (Core System)
*   **Task 2.2:** Implement Flexible Workflow Engine
    *   *Description:* Build the underlying system for managing mode transitions, passing context effectively, and interacting with the `project_journal` for state persistence.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Code (Core System)
*   **Task 2.3:** Implement Proactive Intent Analysis Engine
    *   *Description:* Implement the logic designed in Task 1.3 to analyze initial user input and determine the appropriate response path (A-E).
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Code (Core System)
*   **Task 2.4:** Update `roo-commander` Mode Logic
    *   *Description:* Refactor the `roo-commander` mode's instructions and internal logic to incorporate the new Proactive Intent flow.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Roo Commander Mode Specialist (or Code)
*   **Task 2.5:** Implement `project_journal` Updates
    *   *Description:* Implement the schema changes defined in Task 1.4, potentially involving updates to `Secretary` or core file handling.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Secretary, Code (Core System)
*   **Task 2.6:** Implement Optional User Profile Feature
    *   *Description:* Build the UI and backend logic for the optional user profile feature.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Frontend Developer, API Developer (if applicable), Code (Core System)

### Phase 3: Mode Integration & Adaptation

*Goal: Ensure existing modes work seamlessly within the new flexible workflow and leverage persona context.*

*   **Task 3.1:** Review/Update Specialist Modes for Persona Alignment
    *   *Description:* Review existing specialist modes to ensure their behavior aligns with the needs of relevant personas. Make necessary adjustments to instructions or capabilities.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Individual Mode Specialists, Code Reviewer
*   **Task 3.2:** Integrate Modes with Flexible Workflow
    *   *Description:* Update modes to correctly handle context passed from other modes and to persist relevant state information to the `project_journal` as needed.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Individual Mode Specialists, Code (Core System)
*   **Task 3.3:** Implement Mode-Specific Suggestions (Proactive Intent)
    *   *Description:* Enhance modes to provide context-aware suggestions for next steps or related modes, contributing to the proactive nature of the system.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Individual Mode Specialists, Code (Core System)

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation

*Goal: Ensure the new system is robust, reliable, and well-documented.*

*   **Task 4.1:** Integration Testing for Workflow Transitions
    *   *Description:* Test various sequences of mode switching and context passing to ensure stability and data integrity.
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* Integration Tester
*   **Task 4.2:** Persona-Based Scenario Testing
    *   *Description:* Execute end-to-end tests based on the defined personas and their expected workflows (e.g., Vibe Coder starts coding then adds docs).
    *   *Lead Mode(s):* E2E Tester
*   **Task 4.3:** Proactive Intent Accuracy Testing
    *   *Description:* Test the Proactive Intent engine with various inputs to ensure it correctly identifies directives and intent, offering appropriate suggestions.
