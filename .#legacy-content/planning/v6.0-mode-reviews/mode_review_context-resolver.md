# Mode Review: context-resolver

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/context-resolver.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode reads specified or relevant project journal files (tasks, decisions, planning docs) and synthesizes a concise summary based on the query received. It is a read-only mode designed to provide context to other modes.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** The mode correctly does *not* create its own task log, as it performs read-only summarization. It uses `attempt_completion` appropriately to return the requested information.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The mode's effectiveness depends on the quality and consistency of the project journal entries it reads.
*   The example summary structure provided is helpful.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`.` (Note: No trailing space this time based on the file content)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
