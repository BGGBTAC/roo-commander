# Mode Review: complex-problem-solver

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/complex-problem-solver.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode focuses on in-depth analysis of complex technical problems, evaluating potential solutions, and providing justified recommendations. It produces a formal analysis report.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The mode correctly handles Task IDs, initializes and updates the specific task log file, saves its formal output correctly, and uses `attempt_completion` appropriately, referencing relevant artifacts.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The mode is well-structured for its analytical purpose. It correctly avoids making direct code changes.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`. ` (Note the trailing space)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
