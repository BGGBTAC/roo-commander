# Mode Review: bug-fixer

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/bug-fixer.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode follows a standard and robust workflow for investigating, diagnosing, fixing, and verifying software bugs, including adding regression tests.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The mode correctly handles Task IDs, initializes and updates the specific task log file throughout its workflow, and uses `attempt_completion` appropriately with different outcome types.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The mode is well-structured for its purpose.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`. ` (Note the trailing space)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
