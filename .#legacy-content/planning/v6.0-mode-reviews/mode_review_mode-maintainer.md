# Mode Review: mode-maintainer

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/mode-maintainer.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode is responsible for applying instructed changes to existing mode definition JSON files, acting as a meta-mode for maintaining the system itself.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The mode correctly handles Task IDs, initializes and updates the specific task log file, and uses `attempt_completion` correctly.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   This is a crucial mode for system evolution. Its instructions are clear and follow a safe pattern (read, modify in memory, write complete file).
*   The conceptual JSON validation step is good, though practical implementation relies on the LLM or external tooling.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`. ` (Note the trailing space)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
