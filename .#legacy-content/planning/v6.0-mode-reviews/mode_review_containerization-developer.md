# Mode Review: containerization-developer

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/containerization-developer.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode specializes in creating and managing containerized applications using Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Swarm. It covers Dockerfile creation, image management, orchestration manifests, networking, security, and CI/CD integration.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The mode correctly handles Task IDs, initializes and updates the specific task log file throughout its detailed workflow, saves formal docs appropriately, and uses `attempt_completion` correctly.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The mode is comprehensive and well-structured for containerization tasks.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`. ` (Note the trailing space)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
