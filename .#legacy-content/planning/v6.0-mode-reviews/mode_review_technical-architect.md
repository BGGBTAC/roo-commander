# Mode Review: technical-architect

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/technical-architect.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode is responsible for high-level system design, technology selection, defining architecture, addressing non-functional requirements, documenting decisions (ADRs), and guiding implementation.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The mode correctly handles Task IDs, initializes and updates the specific task log file throughout its detailed workflow, saves formal documents (architecture, decisions) correctly, delegates diagramming appropriately, and uses `attempt_completion` correctly.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The workflow is comprehensive and covers key architectural responsibilities.
*   The explicit steps for documenting decisions (ADRs) and requesting diagrams are good practices.
*   The mode correctly identifies its role in guiding implementation and mitigating risks.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`. ` (Note the trailing space)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
