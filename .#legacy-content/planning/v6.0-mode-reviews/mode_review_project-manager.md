# Mode Review: project-manager

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/project-manager.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode acts as the central coordinator for the Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) system. It is responsible for creating, defining, tracking, and delegating tasks defined in markdown files within the `project_journal/tasks/` structure.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` References:** None found. It correctly references the MDTM documentation within the project journal.
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. This mode *defines* and executes the core MDTM workflow, including creating task files, updating statuses, delegating based on task files, monitoring progress via files, and logging its own PM activities separately.

## Recommendations for Change

*   None required regarding `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` removal or basic MDTM alignment.

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   This mode is critical for the structured task management approach. Its instructions are detailed and seem robust.
*   The emphasis on using `apply_diff` for status updates in task files is good practice for efficiency.
*   The distinction between the PM's log (`[PM_TaskID].md`) and the feature task logs is well-defined.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   No changes proposed based on this review's scope.
