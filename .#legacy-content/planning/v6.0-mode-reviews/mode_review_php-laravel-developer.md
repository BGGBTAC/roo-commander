# Mode Review: php-laravel-developer

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/php-laravel-developer.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode specializes in building web applications using PHP and the Laravel framework, covering backend logic, Blade templates, Eloquent ORM, migrations, testing, and Artisan commands.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The mode correctly handles Task IDs, initializes and updates the specific task log file throughout its workflow, and uses `attempt_completion` correctly.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The mode covers the full stack aspects typical of Laravel development (backend, frontend templates, DB).
*   It correctly identifies relevant Artisan commands and testing tools.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`. ` (Note the trailing space)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
