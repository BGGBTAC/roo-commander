# Mode Review: context-condenser

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/context-condenser.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode is highly specialized, designed to execute a specific Standard Operating Procedure (SOP v2.1) embedded within its instructions. The SOP guides the mode through reading source documentation (files, directories, URLs), analyzing it, and generating a structured "Condensed Context Index" markdown file intended for embedding in other modes.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` References:** None found. The mode relies entirely on its embedded SOP.
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The embedded SOP explicitly details receiving a Task ID, initializing and updating the specific task log file (`project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`), saving its output (the index file), and using `attempt_completion` correctly with references.

## Recommendations for Change

*   None required regarding `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` removal or basic MDTM alignment.

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The mode's effectiveness is entirely dependent on the quality and execution of the embedded SOP.
*   The SOP itself is quite complex and relies heavily on the LLM's analytical capabilities (concept clustering, keyword extraction, summarization, token awareness). Its success may vary depending on the LLM and the source material's complexity.
*   Consideration could be given to extracting the SOP into a separate document in `project_journal/knowledge/` for easier maintenance, though embedding it ensures the mode always has its core logic available.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   No changes proposed based on this review's scope.
