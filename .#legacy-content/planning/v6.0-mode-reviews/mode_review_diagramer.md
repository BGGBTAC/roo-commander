# Mode Review: diagramer

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/diagramer.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode is responsible for generating or updating Mermaid diagram syntax based on conceptual instructions and saving the result to a specified file path. It acts as a utility for other modes.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** The mode intentionally does not handle Task IDs or create task logs, as instructed ("Do NOT log actions."). This is acceptable for a simple utility mode whose actions are typically logged by the delegating mode as part of a larger task. It uses `attempt_completion` correctly.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The mode's focus on generating the complete Mermaid syntax and using `write_to_file` is appropriate for its function.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`.` (Note: No trailing space this time based on the file content)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
