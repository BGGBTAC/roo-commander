# Mode Review: research-context-builder

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/research-context-builder.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode gathers information from web sources or local files based on a query, synthesizes the findings, and saves a structured summary document.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The mode correctly handles Task IDs, initializes and updates the specific task log file, saves its formal output correctly, and uses `attempt_completion` appropriately, referencing relevant artifacts.

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The mode correctly utilizes the `browser` tool for external research.
*   Saving the synthesized summary to `formal_docs` is appropriate.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`. ` (Note the trailing space)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
