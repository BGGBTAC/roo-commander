# Mode Review: git-manager

**Mode File:** `roo-modes-dev/git-manager.json`

## Analysis Summary

This mode executes Git commands based on instructions, handling common operations like branching, committing, merging, pushing, and pulling. It includes safety checks for destructive commands and basic conflict handling.

## Findings & Concerns

1.  **Obsolete File Reference:** The `customInstructions` contain one reference to the now-obsolete `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` file in Step 1: "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."
2.  **MDTM Alignment:** Excellent alignment. The mode correctly handles Task IDs, initializes and updates the specific task log file throughout its workflow, and uses `attempt_completion` correctly with different outcome types (Success, FailedConflict, etc.).

## Recommendations for Change

1.  **Remove `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` Reference:** Modify Step 1 in `customInstructions` to remove the sentence "Adhere to guidelines in `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md`."

## Other Notes/Ideas

*   The safety check for destructive commands is crucial.
*   The handling of complex merge/rebase conflicts (reporting failure) is appropriate.

## Proposed Changes (JSON `customInstructions`)

*   **Search:** `Adhere to guidelines in \\\`ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM\\.md\\\`. ` (Note the trailing space)
*   **Replace:** (Empty string)
