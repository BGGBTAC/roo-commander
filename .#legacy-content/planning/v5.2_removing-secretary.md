Okay, since you're proceeding with removing the `secretary` mode, here's a step-by-step guide on the changes required across your configuration files, primarily focusing on modifying the `customInstructions` for various modes.

**Core Principle:** Everywhere a mode was previously instructed to delegate a file write/append operation to the `secretary` via `new_task`, it must now be instructed to perform that operation *directly* using the appropriate file system tool (`write_to_file` or `insert_content`/`apply_diff`).

**Changes Required by Category:**

1.  **Task Logging (Initialization, Updates, Completion):**
    *   **Affected Modes:** Nearly all specialist modes, plus `roo-commander` and `project-manager` for their own logs/actions.
    *   **Change:** Replace instructions like "**Guidance:** Log ..., preferably using the `secretary` mode (via `new_task`) targeting `project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`..."
    *   **With:** Instructions like "**Directly create/append** [goal/update/summary] to `project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md` using `write_to_file` or `insert_content`." for initialization, and "**Directly append** [update/summary] to the task log ... using `insert_content`." for updates and completion summaries.
    *   **Example (`technical-architect` - Step 1):**
        *   *Before (v5.1):* `**Guidance:** Log the initial goal ..., preferably using the `secretary` mode (via `new_task`) targeting `project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`.`
        *   *After (Direct Write):* `**Directly create/append** the initial goal to `project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md` using `write_to_file` or `insert_content`.`
    *   **Example (`technical-architect` - Step 11, Completion Log):**
        *   *Before (v5.1):* `**Guidance:** Log completion, preferably using the `secretary` mode (via `new_task`) targeting `project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`.`
        *   *After (Direct Write):* `**Directly append** final status, outcome, summary, and references to the task log (`project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content`.`

2.  **Saving Formal Documents:**
    *   **Affected Modes:** `technical-architect`, `project-manager`, `api-developer`, `ui-designer`, `code-reviewer`, `integration-tester`, `security-specialist`, `technical-writer`, `research-context-builder`, `second-opinion`, `complex-problem-solver`, `accessibility-specialist`, `performance-optimizer`, `infrastructure-specialist`, `containerization-developer`, `cicd-specialist`, `database-specialist` (potentially others producing distinct artifacts).
    *   **Change:** Replace instructions like "**Guidance:** Save the document, preferably using the `secretary` mode (via `new_task`) targeting `project_journal/formal_docs/[filename]`..."
    *   **With:** Instructions like "**Directly write** the file to `project_journal/formal_docs/[filename]` using `write_to_file`." Ensure the mode is instructed to prepare the *full final content* before calling `write_to_file`.
    *   **Example (`api-developer` - Step 5):**
        *   *Before (v5.1):* `**Guidance:** Save the documentation file, preferably using the `secretary` mode (via `new_task`) targeting a standard location like `docs/api/openapi.yaml` or `project_journal/formal_docs/openapi_spec_vX.yaml`.`
        *   *After (Direct Write):* `Prepare the full content and **directly write** the final file to `project_journal/formal_docs/openapi_spec_vX.yaml` using `write_to_file`.` (Adjust path as needed).

3.  **Saving Decision Records (ADRs):**
    *   **Affected Modes:** `roo-commander`, `technical-architect`, potentially `project-manager` or others making key decisions.
    *   **Change:** Replace instructions like "**Guidance:** create decision record via `secretary` (`new_task`) targeting `project_journal/decisions/YYYYMMDD-topic.md`..."
    *   **With:** Instructions like "**Directly write** an ADR file to `project_journal/decisions/YYYYMMDD-topic.md` using `write_to_file`."
    *   **Example (`roo-commander` - Step 6):**
        *   *Before (v5.1):* `For significant project decisions, **Guidance:** create decision record via `secretary` (`new_task`) targeting `project_journal/decisions/YYYYMMDD-topic.md`...`
        *   *After (Direct Write):* `For significant project-level decisions, **directly write** an ADR file to `project_journal/decisions/YYYYMMDD-topic.md` using `write_to_file`.`

4.  **Diagram Writing (`diagramer` Mode):**
    *   **Affected Mode:** `diagramer`.
    *   **Change:** Modify the `diagramer`'s instructions. It should no longer delegate the write.
    *   **Replace Step 5 (Delegate Write) & 6 (Confirm Completion):**
        *   *Before (v5.1):* Delegated write to `secretary`.
        *   *After (Direct Write):* Add a new step: "**Write Diagram File:** Prepare the full content (including Markdown heading and
