# Task Log: d3js-specialist-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the D3.js Specialist mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/d3js-specialist.md` according to the final conventions.
**Subject:** D3.js Specialist mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Mode system maintainers and developers
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent organization and metadata for the D3.js Specialist mode
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/d3js-specialist.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Analysis and Classification

Based on the mode classification guide:

1. **Level Determination**: 
   - The D3.js Specialist is focused on executing specific implementation tasks related to data visualization using D3.js
   - It's not a top-level coordinator, director, or lead
   - It's a worker-level mode that executes specific tasks
   - **Classification**: `03x-worker` level

2. **Department Determination**:
   - The mode focuses on frontend development (creating visualizations for web browsers using JavaScript)
   - It integrates with frontend frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte
   - It's tagged with "frontend" in its metadata
   - **Classification**: `031-frontend` department

3. **Target Location**:
   - Path: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/d3js-specialist/`
   - Filename: `031-work-fe-d3js-specialist.mode.md`

## Metadata Updates Required

- Add `Level: 031-worker-frontend`
- Add `Categories: ["Frontend", "Data Visualization"]`
- Update format of Tool Groups and Tags to match template
- Add `Delegates To`, `Escalates To`, and `Reports To` fields
- Update API Configuration format

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the target directory if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the source file to the target location with the new filename
3. Update the metadata in the new file according to the template
4. Delete the original source file after successful processing
