# Sub-Task: Refine Mode - 035-work-do-infrastructure-specialist.mode.md

**Master Task:** project_journal/tasks/TASK-PM-20250413-090710-v7-mode-refinement.md
**Status:** Complete ‚úÖ
**Coordinator:** roo-commander
**Assigned To:** technical-writer

## Potential `.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/` Needs

The Infrastructure Specialist mode would benefit from the following context files:

1. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/aws-best-practices.md`**: Best practices for AWS infrastructure design, security, and cost optimization.
2. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/azure-best-practices.md`**: Best practices for Azure infrastructure design, security, and cost optimization.
3. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/gcp-best-practices.md`**: Best practices for GCP infrastructure design, security, and cost optimization.
4. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/terraform-patterns.md`**: Common Terraform patterns, modules, and best practices.
5. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/cloudformation-patterns.md`**: Common CloudFormation patterns, templates, and best practices.
6. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/pulumi-patterns.md`**: Common Pulumi patterns, components, and best practices.
7. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/networking-reference.md`**: Reference for common networking configurations (VPCs, subnets, security groups, etc.).
8. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/security-reference.md`**: Reference for infrastructure security best practices and common IAM policies.
9. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/monitoring-logging-patterns.md`**: Common patterns for setting up monitoring and logging infrastructure.
10. **`.roo/context/infrastructure-specialist/disaster-recovery-templates.md`**: Templates and strategies for disaster recovery and business continuity.

These context files would provide specialized knowledge that the Infrastructure Specialist can reference when designing, implementing, and managing infrastructure, without cluttering the main project record.

## Changes Made

1. Updated the metadata sections:
   - Added "Security" to Categories
   - Added `technical-writer` to Delegates To
   - Added `devops-lead` to Escalates To
   - Added `devops-lead` to Reports To (as primary reporting line)

2. Identified potential `.roo/context/` needs as listed above.

The mode file was already well-structured and compliant with v7 standards, with all required sections present and the emoji (üèóÔ∏è) already assigned.
