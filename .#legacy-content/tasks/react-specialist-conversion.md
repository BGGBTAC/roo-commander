# Task Log: React Specialist Mode Conversion

**Goal:** Convert the React Specialist mode from v6.3 JSON format to v7.0 Markdown format following the final conventions.

**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Mode system maintainers and developers
**Purpose:** Document the conversion process and ensure proper implementation of the mode file conventions

## Initial Assessment

The source file for the React Specialist mode was identified at `v6.3/modes/react-specialist.json`. This file needed to be converted to the new Markdown format and placed in the appropriate directory structure according to the mode hierarchy and classification guides.

## Conversion Process

1. **Source File Review**
   - Reviewed the source file at `v6.3/modes/react-specialist.json`
   - Identified key metadata: slug, name, role definition, custom instructions, groups, tags, description, and API configuration

2. **Target Location Determination**
   - Based on the mode classification guides, determined that React Specialist belongs to the Frontend department within the Worker level (031)
   - Target folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/react-specialist/`
   - Target filename: `031-work-fe-react-specialist.mode.md` following the convention `[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md`

3. **File Verification**
   - Found that the file had already been created at `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/react-specialist/031-work-fe-react-specialist.mode.md`
   - Verified the file's content and structure to ensure it follows the conventions

4. **Content Verification**
   - Confirmed the file includes all required sections:
     - Mode name and slug
     - Description
     - Capabilities
     - Workflow
     - Role Definition
     - Custom Instructions (with detailed workflow steps)
     - Metadata (Level, Tool Groups, Tags, Categories, Stack, Delegates To, Escalates To, Reports To, API Configuration)
   - All metadata from the source JSON file was properly transferred to the new format

## Findings

The React Specialist mode file has been successfully converted to the new format and is located at `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/react-specialist/031-work-fe-react-specialist.mode.md`. The file follows all the conventions specified in the final convention ADR and includes all required metadata.

No issues or missing information were identified during the verification process.
