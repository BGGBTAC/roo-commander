# Task Log: Project Onboarding Conversion

**Goal:** Convert and migrate the `project-onboarding.md` mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/` to the appropriate location following the v7.0 mode conventions.

**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Document the process of converting the Project Onboarding mode to the final v7.0 conventions
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/project-onboarding.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Process

### 1. Review Source File
Reviewed the source mode file `v7.0/modes/md/project-onboarding.md`. The file contains:
- Mode name and slug: ðŸš¦ Project Onboarding (`project-onboarding`)
- Description, capabilities, and workflow sections
- Role definition
- Custom instructions with operational principles, workflow steps, collaboration details, etc.
- Metadata including tool groups, tags, delegation information, and API configuration

### 2. Determine Classification and Target Location
Based on the mode classification guide:
- **Level Classification**: Project Onboarding is a Director level mode (Level 1: `010-director`) as it "manages a significant phase of the project (onboarding)" and "translates high-level goals into plans for others".
- **Target Folder**: `v7.0/modes/010-director/project-onboarding/`
- **Filename Convention**: Following the pattern `[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md`, the filename should be `010-dir-project-onboarding.mode.md`
- **Full Path**: `v7.0/modes/010-director/project-onboarding/010-dir-project-onboarding.mode.md`

### 3. Create Target Folder
Checked if the target folder exists. The `v7.0/modes/010-director` directory exists but needed the `project-onboarding` subfolder.
Created the `project-onboarding` subfolder using `mkdir -p v7.0/modes/010-director/project-onboarding`.

### 4. Copy and Update Mode File
Created the new mode file at `v7.0/modes/010-director/project-onboarding/010-dir-project-onboarding.mode.md` with the following updates:
- Maintained all original content (description, capabilities, workflow, role definition, custom instructions)
- Updated the metadata section:
  - Added proper Level: `010-director`
  - Formatted Tool Groups as a YAML list with hyphens
  - Formatted Tags as a YAML list with hyphens
  - Added Categories: `Director`
  - Maintained Delegates To, Escalates To, and Reports To sections
  - Updated API Configuration to use YAML list format: `- model: gemini-2.5-pro`

### 5. Verification
The converted mode file follows all the conventions specified in:
- Mode hierarchy guide
- Mode folder structure guide
- Mode classification guide
- Final convention ADR

### 6. Delete Original Source File
Deleted the original source file `v7.0/modes/md/project-onboarding.md` as it's no longer needed after successful migration.
