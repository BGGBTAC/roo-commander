# Task Log: TASK-PM-20250413-090710 - Master Task: v7.0 Mode Refinement

**Goal:** Methodically review and update all mode files within `v7.0/modes/` to ensure consistency, completeness, and alignment with v7 standards and the hybrid context strategy.

**Context:** This task initiates the plan detailed in `v7.0/future-planning/current-status-and-mode-refinement-plan.md` (Section 2: Next Phase).

**Initial Checklist:**
- [x] Generate sub-tasks for each mode file in `v7.0/modes/`. (Completed via Project Manager delegation 2025-04-13)
- [x] Define delegation strategy for sub-tasks (e.g., assign to `technical-writer`). (Strategy: Assign all to `technical-writer` as per plan, completed 2025-04-13)
- [x] Monitor sub-task progress. (All sub-tasks completed 2025-04-13)
- [x] Update `v7.0/future-planning/mode-manifest-org-chart.md` as sub-tasks complete. (Completed by Technical Writer 2025-04-13)
- [x] Final review of all modes and manifest. (Completed by Roo Commander 2025-04-13)

## Progress Updates

### 2025-04-13 (Technical Writer)

The `v7.0/future-planning/mode-manifest-org-chart.md` file has been updated to reflect the current state of the refined v7.0 modes. The updated manifest includes:

1. A comprehensive listing of all modes organized by hierarchy level (00x-executive, 01x-director, 02x-lead, 03x-worker, 04x-assistant, 05x-footgun)
2. Appropriate emojis for each mode
3. Departmental organization within each level
4. An updated Mermaid diagram showing the organizational structure and reporting relationships
5. Status change from "Proposed" to "Active"

The manifest now accurately represents the current state of the v7.0 mode structure and can serve as a reference for both users and AI modes.

### 2025-04-13 (Roo Commander)

All sub-tasks assigned to the Technical Writer for mode refinement have been completed successfully. The `mode-manifest-org-chart.md` has also been updated. A final review confirms that all v7.0 modes are now aligned with the defined standards and the hybrid context strategy. This master task is now complete.
