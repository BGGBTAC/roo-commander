**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Document the conversion process of the Context Resolver mode to the final v7.0 conventions
**References:**

## Process Steps

1. **Review Source File**
   - Reviewed `v7.0/modes/md/context-resolver.md`
   - Identified as a Level 4: `040-assistant` mode based on the classification guide
   - Noted metadata needs updating (Level, API Configuration format)

2. **Determine Target Location**
   - Based on hierarchy: Level 4 (`040-assistant`)
   - Target folder: `v7.0/modes/040-assistant/context-resolver/`
   - Target filename: `040-asst-context-resolver.mode.md` (following hyphenated convention)

3. **Create Target Structure**
   - Created target folder: `v7.0/modes/040-assistant/context-resolver/`
   - Copied and updated the mode file to the target location

4. **Update Mode File**
   - Updated the Level metadata to `040-assistant`
   - Reformatted the API Configuration to use YAML list format
   - Added appropriate Categories and Stack information
   - Added appropriate delegation relationships (Reports To, Escalates To)
   - Saved the file as `040-asst-context-resolver.mode.md`

5. **Verification**
   - Confirmed the file was successfully created at the target location
   - Verified all content was properly migrated and formatted according to conventions

6. **Cleanup**
   - Deleted the original source file `v7.0/modes/md/context-resolver.md`
