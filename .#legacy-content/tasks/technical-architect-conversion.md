**Goal:** Process the `technical-architect.md` file from `v7.0/modes/md/` as part of the mode migration process, applying the final conventions.

**Subject:** Technical Architect mode file conversion
**Audience:** Roo Mode System maintainers
**Purpose:** Document the conversion process and ensure proper application of the v7.0 mode conventions
**References:** 
- Source file: `v7.0/modes/md/technical-architect.md`
- Mode hierarchy guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- Mode folder structure guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`

- Final convention ADR: `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Process Steps

1. **Review Source File**
   - Reviewed `v7.0/modes/md/technical-architect.md` for completeness and clarity
   - The file contains all necessary sections: Description, Capabilities, Workflow, Role Definition, Custom Instructions, and Metadata
   - Some metadata fields need to be updated to match the new conventions

2. **Determine Target Location**
   - Based on the mode hierarchy guide, Technical Architect is a Level 1: Director mode
   - Target folder: `v7.0/modes/010-director/technical-architect/`
   - Target filename: `010-dir-technical-architect.mode.md` (following the convention `[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md`)

3. **Metadata Updates Required**
   - Add Level: `010-director`
   - Update Tool Groups format to YAML list (using hyphens)
   - Update Tags format to YAML list (using hyphens)
   - Add Categories (based on mode function)
   - Add Stack if applicable
   - Update API Configuration format to simple YAML list

4. **Implementation**
   - Created the target directory `v7.0/modes/010-director/technical-architect/`
   - Created the new mode file `v7.0/modes/010-director/technical-architect/010-dir-technical-architect.mode.md`
   - Updated the metadata section with the following changes:
     - Added Level: `010-director`
     - Reformatted Tool Groups as a YAML list with hyphens
     - Reformatted Tags as a YAML list with hyphens
     - Added Categories: Architecture, Technical Leadership, System Design
     - Added Stack: Architecture, System Design, Documentation
     - Reformatted API Configuration as a simple YAML list
   - Reformatted the Capabilities section to use hyphens for consistency
