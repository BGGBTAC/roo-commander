# Task Log: django-developer-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the Django Developer mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/django-developer.md` according to the final v7.0 conventions.
**Subject:** Django Developer mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Mode system maintainers and developers
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file organization and metadata format
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/django-developer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Process Steps

1. Review source mode file `v7.0/modes/md/django-developer.md`
2. Determine correct target location based on hierarchy and classification guides
3. Create target folder if needed
4. Copy and update the mode file with correct metadata and conventions
5. Document any issues or missing information
6. Optionally delete the original source file

## Analysis

Based on the mode hierarchy and classification guides:
- **Level:** 032-worker-backend (Django Developer is a backend worker mode)
- **Department Shortcode:** be (for backend)
- **Target Folder:** `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/032-backend/django-developer/`
- **Target Filename:** `032-work-be-django-developer.mode.md` (following the hyphenated convention)

## Metadata Updates

The following metadata fields were updated or added:
- **Level:** Set to `032-worker-backend`
- **Tool Groups:** Formatted as a YAML list with hyphens
- **Tags:** Maintained existing tags, formatted as a YAML list with hyphens
- **Categories:** Added `Backend`, `Web Framework`, and `Python` categories
- **Stack:** Added `Django`, `Python`, `Django REST Framework`, and `WSGI/ASGI`
- **Delegates To:** Added `integration-tester` and `e2e-tester`
- **Escalates To:** Added `api-developer`, `database-specialist`, `infrastructure-specialist`, `containerization-developer`, and `frontend-developer`
- **Reports To:** Added `roo-commander`, `technical-architect`, and `project-manager`
- **API Configuration:** Updated to use the simple YAML list format

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully migrated the Django Developer mode file to the new location following the v7.0 conventions. Created the appropriate directory structure, updated the metadata format, and ensured all required fields were properly populated.
