## Completion Summary

The File Repair Specialist mode file has been successfully reviewed and updated according to v7 standards. The following changes were made:

1. **Verified all standard sections** - All required sections were already present and well-structured.
2. **Confirmed emoji** - The ðŸ”§ emoji was already correctly assigned.
3. **Reviewed core content** - Description, Capabilities, Workflow, and Role Definition were already detailed and accurate.
4. **Validated metadata**:
   - Level: Confirmed as "040-assistant" which matches its directory structure.
   - Tags: Confirmed appropriate tags were present.
   - Categories: Added appropriate categories: utility, maintenance, error-handling.
   - Stack: Confirmed as "[N/A]" which is appropriate for this general utility mode.
   - Delegates To: Confirmed as "[N/A]" which is appropriate as this mode doesn't typically delegate tasks.
   - Escalates To: Confirmed appropriate escalation paths to "complex-problem-solver" and relevant specialists.
   - Reports To: Confirmed as "(Calling Mode/Task)" which is appropriate.
5. **Standardized API Configuration** - Updated from "quasar-alpha" to "gemini-2.5-pro" as per standards.
6. **Identified potential `.roo/context/` needs** - Added suggestions for context files that would benefit this mode:
   - `.roo/context/file-repair-specialist/corruption-patterns.md`
   - `.roo/context/file-repair-specialist/file-formats.md`
   - `.roo/context/file-repair-specialist/encoding-reference.md`

The mode is now fully compliant with v7 standards and ready for use within the Roo Commander system.
