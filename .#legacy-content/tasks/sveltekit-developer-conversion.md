# Task Log: sveltekit-developer-conversion - Technical Writing: SvelteKit Developer Mode Migration

**Goal:** Process the SvelteKit Developer mode file (`v7.0/modes/md/sveltekit-developer.md`) according to the v7.0 mode conventions.
**Subject:** SvelteKit Developer mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Project maintainers and developers
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file structure and naming conventions across the project
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/sveltekit-developer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md` (template)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md` (hierarchy guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md` (folder structure guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md` (classification guide)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md` (final convention ADR)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_format_confirmation.md` (file format ADR)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_conventions_refinement.md` (conventions refinement ADR)

## Process Summary

1. **Review of Source File:**
   - Reviewed the source file `v7.0/modes/md/sveltekit-developer.md`
   - Identified it as a frontend framework specialist mode (Level 3 - Worker)

2. **Target Location Determination:**
   - Based on the mode hierarchy and classification guides, determined the appropriate level: `031-worker-frontend`
   - Created the target folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/sveltekit-developer/`

3. **File Creation with Updated Conventions:**
   - Created the mode file with the hyphenated naming convention: `031-work-fe-sveltekit-developer.mode.md`
   - Applied the final conventions for metadata formatting:
     - Used standard YAML lists for tags and tool groups
     - Formatted API Configuration as a simple YAML list
     - Added missing metadata fields (Categories, Stack, Delegates To, Escalates To, Reports To)
     - Added missing sections (Key Considerations, Error Handling)

4. **Enhancements and Additions:**
   - Added appropriate Categories: Frontend, Web Development, JavaScript Frameworks
   - Added Stack information: SvelteKit, Svelte, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vite
   - Added delegation and reporting relationships based on the mode's role and responsibilities
   - Expanded Key Considerations and Error Handling sections with relevant content

---

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully migrated the SvelteKit Developer mode file to the new location with the updated conventions. Added missing metadata and sections to ensure completeness.
