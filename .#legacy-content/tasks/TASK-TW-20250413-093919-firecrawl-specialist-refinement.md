## Identified `.roo/context/` Needs
The following potential context files could be created for the Firecrawl Specialist mode:

1. `.roo/context/firecrawl-specialist/api-reference.md` - Detailed API reference documentation including all endpoints, parameters, and response formats.
2. `.roo/context/firecrawl-specialist/example-payloads.json` - Example JSON payloads for different types of requests (scrape, crawl) with various configuration options.
3. `.roo/context/firecrawl-specialist/error-handling-guide.md` - Comprehensive guide for handling common API errors and troubleshooting steps.

## Completion Summary
The Firecrawl Specialist mode file has been reviewed and updated to ensure alignment with v7 standards. The file already had a well-structured format with all required sections present. The emoji (ðŸ”¥) was verified as appropriate for the mode. The Tool Groups section was standardized to match the template format. Potential `.roo/context/` needs were identified to enhance the mode's capabilities with specialized knowledge bases.
