# Task Log: Performance Optimizer Mode Conversion

**Goal:** Convert `v7.0/modes/md/performance-optimizer.md` to the v7.0 mode file structure and conventions.

**Subject:** Performance Optimizer mode file migration
**Purpose:** Standardize mode file format and location according to v7.0 conventions
**References:** 
- Source file: `v7.0/modes/md/performance-optimizer.md`
- Mode hierarchy: `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- Folder structure: `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- Classification guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- Mode template: `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- Final convention ADR: `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the Performance Optimizer mode file and the classification guides, I've determined:

1. **Level Classification:** This mode functions as a Worker (Level 3) as it executes specific implementation tasks related to performance optimization.
2. **Department Classification:** Since it works across multiple domains (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure), it best fits in the Cross-Functional department (`039-worker-cross-functional`).
3. **Target Location:** 
   - Folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/performance-optimizer/`
   - Filename: `039-work-xf-performance-optimizer.mode.md` (following the hyphenated convention)

## Metadata Updates Required

The following metadata fields need to be updated or added:
- **Level:** `039-worker-cross-functional`
- **Categories:** Cross-Functional, Performance
- **Stack:** Missing in source file, needs to be determined
- **API Configuration:** Format needs to be updated to YAML list format

## Missing Information

The source file has the following missing or ambiguous information:
- **Level:** Currently marked as "[Specify Level - e.g., Specialist, Expert - Not in v6.3]"
- **Categories:** Currently marked as "[Specify Category - e.g., Analysis, Optimization - Not in v6.3]"
- **Stack:** Currently marked as "[Specify relevant technologies - Not in v6.3]"

## Implementation

The following actions were taken:

1. Created the target folder structure:
   ```
   v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/performance-optimizer/
   ```

2. Created the new mode file with updated metadata:
   - Set **Level** to `039-worker-cross-functional`
   - Added **Categories** as `Cross-Functional`, `Performance`, and `Optimization`
   - Added **Stack** items relevant to performance optimization tools and technologies
   - Updated **API Configuration** to use YAML list format

3. The file was saved to:
   ```
   v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/performance-optimizer/039-work-xf-performance-optimizer.mode.md
   ```

4. Deleted the original source file:
   ```
   v7.0/modes/md/performance-optimizer.md
   ```

---

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully migrated the Performance Optimizer mode file to the v7.0 structure. Created the appropriate folder structure, renamed the file according to the hyphenated convention, and updated the metadata fields to match the required format. Added missing information for Level, Categories, and Stack based on the mode's purpose and capabilities. Deleted the original source file after successful migration.
