**Goal:** Process the Git Manager mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/git-manager.md` and migrate it to the appropriate location following the v7.0 conventions.
**Subject:** Git Manager mode file migration
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Document the process of migrating the Git Manager mode file to the v7.0 folder structure and format
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/git-manager.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Process Steps

1. **Review Source File**
   - Reviewed `v7.0/modes/md/git-manager.md` to understand its structure and content
   - Identified Git Manager as a cross-functional worker mode that executes Git commands safely

2. **Determine Target Location**
   - Based on the mode hierarchy guide, Git Manager is classified as a Level 3 Worker mode (03x-worker)
   - Specifically, it belongs to the Cross-Functional department (039-cross-functional)
   - The target folder should be: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/git-manager/`
   - The target filename should follow the convention: `039-work-xf-git-manager.mode.md`

3. **Create Target Folder**
   - Created the folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/git-manager/`

4. **Prepare Mode File Content**
   - Updated the metadata section to include:
     - Level: 039-worker-cross-functional
     - Categories: Cross-Functional, SCM
     - Delegates To: None specified
     - Escalates To: project-manager, roo-commander
     - Reports To: project-manager, roo-commander
     - API Configuration: Updated to use YAML list format
   - Maintained all existing content from the source file
   - Ensured proper formatting according to the template

5. **Create Mode File**
   - Created the file: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/git-manager/039-work-xf-git-manager.mode.md`
   - Verified the file was created successfully

6. **Delete Original Source File**
   - Deleted the original source file: `v7.0/modes/md/git-manager.md`
