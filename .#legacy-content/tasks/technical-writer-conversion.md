# Task Log: Technical Writer Conversion

**Goal:** Process the technical-writer.md file from v7.0/modes/md/ according to the final mode conventions.

**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Document the process of converting the technical-writer mode file to the new format and location
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/technical-writer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Process

1. Reviewed the source file `v7.0/modes/md/technical-writer.md` for completeness and clarity.
2. Determined the correct classification:
   - Level: 039-worker-cross-functional (Level 3 worker in cross-functional department)
   - Department Shortcode: xf (cross-functional)
3. Created the target folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/technical-writer/`
4. Determined the correct filename according to the convention: `039-work-xf-technical-writer.mode.md`
5. Created the new mode file with updated metadata according to the template and conventions.
6. Added the following metadata fields that were not in the original file:
   - Level: 039-worker-cross-functional
   - Categories: Cross-Functional, Documentation
   - Stack: Markdown, RST, Documentation Tools
   - Delegates To: diagramer, react-specialist, python-developer
   - Escalates To: technical-architect, project-manager
   - Reports To: roo-commander, technical-architect, project-manager
7. Updated the API Configuration format to use the simple YAML list format as specified in the final convention ADR.
8. Deleted the original source file `v7.0/modes/md/technical-writer.md` after successful migration.

## Outcome

The technical-writer mode has been successfully migrated to the new location and format:
- Source file: `v7.0/modes/md/technical-writer.md` (deleted)
- Target file: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/technical-writer/039-work-xf-technical-writer.mode.md`

The new file follows all the conventions specified in the final convention ADR, including:
- Fully hyphenated, lowercase filename convention
- Simple YAML list format for API Configuration
- Proper metadata fields with the correct format
