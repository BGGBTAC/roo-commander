## Process Summary

1. **Review Source File**: Examined the source file `v7.0/modes/md/remix-developer.md` for completeness and content.

   ```
   v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/remix-developer/
   ```

4. **Create Updated File**: Created the new mode file with the proper naming convention:
   ```
   031-work-fe-remix-developer.mode.md
   ```

   - Added missing Level field: `031-worker-frontend`
   - Added missing Categories: `Frontend`, `Backend`, `Fullstack`
   - Added missing Stack items: `Remix`, `React`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Node.js`
   - Added missing Reports To: `frontend-developer`, `project-manager`
   - Formatted API Configuration as a YAML list
   - Added Error Handling section that was missing in the original file

6. **Formatting**: Ensured all formatting follows the conventions in the template and ADRs.

7. **Cleanup**: Deleted the original source file `v7.0/modes/md/remix-developer.md` after successful migration.
