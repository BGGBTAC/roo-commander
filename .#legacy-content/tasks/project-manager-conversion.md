# Task Log: Project Manager Mode Conversion

**Goal:** Process the Project Manager mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/project-manager.md` according to the final v7.0 conventions.

**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file organization and metadata
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/project-manager.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md` (template)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md` (hierarchy guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md` (folder structure guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md` (classification guide)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md` (final conventions)

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the source file and guides, I've determined:

1. **Classification:** Project Manager is a Director level mode (Level 1: `010-director`)
2. **Target Folder:** `v7.0/modes/010-director/project-manager/`
3. **Target Filename:** `010-dir-project-manager.mode.md` (following the convention `[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md`)

## Metadata Assessment

The source file has the following metadata sections that need review:
- **Level:** Not specified in source, needs to be set to `010-director`
- **Tool Groups:** Present and properly formatted
- **Tags:** Present and properly formatted
- **Categories:** Not specified in source, needs to be added
- **Stack:** Not specified in source, needs to be added
- **Delegates To:** Implied but not explicitly listed, needs to be added
- **Escalates To:** Implied but not explicitly listed, needs to be added
- **Reports To:** Implied but not explicitly listed, needs to be added
- **API Configuration:** Present but needs format adjustment to YAML list format

## Next Steps

1. Create the target directory if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the source file to the target location with the proper filename
3. Update the metadata in the new file according to the template and conventions
4. Optionally delete the source file after successful processing

## Implementation

I've completed the following steps:

1. Created the target directory structure: `v7.0/modes/010-director/project-manager/`
2. Created the new mode file: `v7.0/modes/010-director/project-manager/010-dir-project-manager.mode.md`
3. Updated the metadata in the new file:
   - Added **Level:** `010-director`
   - Added **Categories:** `Project Management`, `Process`, `Coordination`
   - Added **Stack:** `MDTM`, `Markdown`, `YAML`
   - Added **Delegates To:** `context-resolver`, `technical-writer`, and various specialist modes
   - Added **Escalates To:** `roo-commander`, `complex-problem-solver`, `technical-architect`, `discovery-agent`, `technical-writer`
   - Added **Reports To:** `roo-commander`
   - Reformatted **API Configuration** to use YAML list format
   - Added a new section "Key Considerations / Safety Protocols" with relevant content
   - Added content to the "Context / Knowledge Base" section

The mode file has been successfully processed according to the final v7.0 conventions.

## Final Status

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully processed the Project Manager mode file from the source location to the target location with proper metadata and formatting according to the v7.0 conventions.
