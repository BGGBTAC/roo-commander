# Task Log: firebase-developer-conversion - Technical Writing: Firebase Developer Mode Conversion

**Goal:** Convert and migrate the Firebase Developer mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/firebase-developer.md` to the appropriate location following the v7.0 mode conventions.

**Subject:** Firebase Developer mode file conversion
**Audience:** Roo Commander team
**Purpose:** Ensure proper organization and standardization of mode files in the v7.0 structure
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/firebase-developer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Analysis

### Mode Classification
Based on the mode classification guide, the Firebase Developer mode is classified as a **Worker** level mode (Level 3) since its primary function is executing specific implementation tasks focused on Firebase technology.

Looking at the department classification criteria:
- Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides server-side functionality
- The mode focuses on implementing server-side logic, APIs, and application integration
- The mode deals with database functionality (Firestore), authentication, and cloud functions

Therefore, the appropriate department is **Backend** (`032-worker-backend`).

### Target Location and Filename
According to the folder structure guide and the final convention refinement:
- **Level Prefix:** `032` (Worker-Backend)
- **Department Shortcode:** `be` (Backend)
- **Mode Slug:** `firebase-developer`

The target location should be:
`v7.0/modes/03x-worker/032-backend/firebase-developer/032-work-be-firebase-developer.mode.md`

### Metadata Updates
The following metadata fields need to be updated or added:
- **Level:** `032-worker-backend`
- **Categories:** `["Backend", "Database", "Cloud"]`
- **Stack:** `["Firebase", "Firestore", "Cloud Functions", "Authentication", "Cloud Storage", "Hosting"]`
- **Delegates To:** (None specified in source)
- **Escalates To:** `["frontend-developer", "backend-developer", "security-specialist", "infrastructure-specialist", "complex-problem-solver", "technical-architect"]`
- **Reports To:** `["roo-commander", "technical-architect"]`
- **API Configuration:** Format updated to YAML list style

## Progress

1. ✅ Reviewed the source mode file
2. ✅ Determined the correct target folder and filename
3. ✅ Create the target folder if needed
4. ✅ Copy and rename the mode file to the target location
5. ✅ Update the new file's metadata according to the template and final conventions
6. ✅ Flag any ambiguous or missing critical information
7. ✅ Create task log `project_journal/tasks/firebase-developer-conversion.md`
8. ⏳ (Optional) Delete the source file `v7.0/modes/md/firebase-developer.md`

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully converted the Firebase Developer mode file to the v7.0 structure. Classified it as a Backend Worker (032-worker-backend) and placed it in the appropriate directory with the correct naming convention. Updated metadata fields according to the template and final conventions.
