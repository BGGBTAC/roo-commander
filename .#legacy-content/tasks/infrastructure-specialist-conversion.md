# Task Log: infrastructure-specialist-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process and migrate the `infrastructure-specialist.md` mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/` to the appropriate location following the v7.0 conventions.

**Subject:** Infrastructure Specialist mode file migration
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Document the process of migrating the Infrastructure Specialist mode file to the v7.0 folder structure and format
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/infrastructure-specialist.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_format_confirmation.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_conventions_refinement.md`

## Process

### 1. Review Source File

Reviewed the source file `v7.0/modes/md/infrastructure-specialist.md`. The file contains:
- Mode name and slug: üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Specialist (`infrastructure-specialist`)
- Description, capabilities, and workflow
- Role definition
- Custom instructions with operational principles, workflow steps, collaboration guidelines, and error handling
- Metadata including tool groups, tags, delegation/escalation information, and API configuration

### 2. Determine Target Location

Based on the mode hierarchy and classification guides:
- Level: `03x-worker` (Level 3)
- Department: `035-devops` (DevOps worker)
- Mode slug: `infrastructure-specialist`

The target folder structure should be:
`v7.0/modes/03x-worker/035-devops/infrastructure-specialist/`

The target filename according to the final convention should be:
`035-work-do-infrastructure-specialist.mode.md`

Where:
- `035` is the level prefix
- `work` is the worker level shortcode
- `do` is the department shortcode for DevOps
- `infrastructure-specialist` is the mode slug
- `.mode.md` is the file extension

### 3. Create Target Folder and File

Created the target folder:
`v7.0/modes/03x-worker/035-devops/infrastructure-specialist/`

Created the target file:
`v7.0/modes/03x-worker/035-devops/infrastructure-specialist/035-work-do-infrastructure-specialist.mode.md`

### 4. Update Metadata and Format

Updated the mode file with the following changes:
- Added the Level metadata field: `035-worker-devops`
- Added Categories metadata: DevOps, Infrastructure, Cloud
- Added Stack metadata with relevant technologies
- Added Reports To metadata: technical-architect, project-manager, roo-commander
- Updated the API Configuration format to use the simple YAML list format
- Ensured all lists use standard YAML list syntax without quotes or backticks

### 5. Delete Source File (Optional)

The source file `v7.0/modes/md/infrastructure-specialist.md` can now be deleted as the migration is complete.
