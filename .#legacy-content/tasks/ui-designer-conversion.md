# Task Log: UI Designer Mode Conversion

**Goal:** Process the UI Designer mode file (`v7.0/modes/md/ui-designer.md`) according to the final mode conventions.

**Subject:** UI Designer mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Mode system maintainers and developers
**Purpose:** Document the conversion process and ensure proper implementation of the mode file conventions
**References:**
- Source file: `v7.0/modes/md/ui-designer.md`
- Mode hierarchy guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- Mode folder structure guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- Mode classification guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- Mode template: `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- Final Convention ADR: `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Initial Analysis

The UI Designer mode is classified as a worker-level mode in the design department. According to the mode hierarchy guide, it belongs to the `030-worker-design` category.

Based on the folder structure guide and the final convention ADR, the mode file should:
1. Be placed in a dedicated folder structure: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/030-design/ui-designer/`
2. Be named using the hyphenated convention: `030-work-des-ui-designer.mode.md`

## Conversion Process

- [✅] Review the source mode file
- [✅] Determine the correct target folder and filename
- [✅] Create the target folder if needed
- [✅] Copy and rename the mode file to the target location
- [✅] Update the new file's metadata according to the template and final conventions
- [✅] Flag any ambiguous or missing critical information
- [✅] Delete the source file (optional)

## Conversion Details

### Source Analysis
The source UI Designer mode file was reviewed and found to be mostly complete. The file contained all the necessary sections including description, capabilities, workflow, role definition, custom instructions, and metadata.

### Target Location
Based on the mode hierarchy and folder structure guides, the UI Designer mode was classified as a worker-level mode in the design department (030-worker-design). The target folder was created at:
`v7.0/modes/03x-worker/030-design/ui-designer/`

### Filename Convention
Following the final convention ADR, the file was named using the hyphenated convention:
`030-work-des-ui-designer.mode.md`

### Metadata Updates
The following updates were made to the metadata section:
- Added proper Level value: `030-worker-design`
- Updated API Configuration to use the simple YAML list format
- Added Categories: `Design`, `UI/UX`

### Potential Issues
The original file had a note about "(Potentially Frontend/Framework Specialists - requires clarification on specific slugs)" in the Delegates To section. This was preserved in the new file as it represents a genuine ambiguity that should be addressed in future updates.

## Outcome
The UI Designer mode file was successfully converted and placed in the correct location with the proper naming convention and metadata format. The file is now compliant with the final mode conventions.
