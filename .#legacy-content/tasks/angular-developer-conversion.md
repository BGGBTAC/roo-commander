**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Migrated and updated the Angular Developer mode file to the new structure and conventions. Created the target directory `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/angular-developer/` and placed the mode file there with the correct naming convention `031_angular-developer.mode.md`. Updated metadata fields including Level, Categories, Stack, and Reports To. Changed the API Configuration model to `claude-3.7-sonnet` for consistency with other modes.
**References:** [`v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/angular-developer/031_angular-developer.mode.md` (created)], [`v7.0/modes/md/angular-developer.md` (source)], [`project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_conventions_refinement.md`], [`project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_format_confirmation.md`]

**Changes Made:**
- Classified the mode as `031-worker-frontend` based on its primary function of implementing Angular applications
- Added missing Categories: "Frontend"
- Added missing Stack items: "Angular", "TypeScript", "RxJS", "HTML", "CSS"
- Set Reports To: "frontend-developer", "commander"
- Updated API Configuration to use `claude-3.7-sonnet` model
- Removed "Delegates To" entries as they were duplicated in "Escalates To"
- Formatted all metadata according to the refined conventions (standard YAML lists without quotes/backticks)

**Note:** The original source file `v7.0/modes/md/angular-developer.md` can now be deleted if desired.
