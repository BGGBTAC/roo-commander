# Task Log: context-condenser-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process and migrate the `context-condenser.md` mode file to the appropriate location with updated conventions
**Subject:** Context Condenser mode file migration
**Audience:** Project team
**Purpose:** Document the migration process and ensure proper application of the final mode file conventions
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/context-condenser.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md` (template)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md` (hierarchy guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md` (folder structure guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md` (classification guide)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md` (final conventions ADR)

## Process Steps

1. **Review Source File**
   - Reviewed `v7.0/modes/md/context-condenser.md`
   - Mode is a specialized assistant that generates dense, structured summaries (Condensed Context Indices) from technical documentation sources
   - Primary purpose is to provide baseline knowledge for embedding into other modes' instructions

2. **Determine Classification**
   - Based on the classification guide, this mode's primary function is providing a specific support service used by other modes
   - Classification: **Level 4 - Assistant (`040-assistant`)**
   - Department shortcode: `asst`

3. **Determine Target Location**
   - Target folder: `v7.0/modes/040-assistant/context-condenser/`
   - Target filename: `040-asst-context-condenser.mode.md` (following the hyphenated convention)

4. **Create Target Folder and Process Mode File**
   - Created the necessary directory structure: `v7.0/modes/040-assistant/context-condenser/`
   - Copied the content from the source file to the target location
   - Updated the metadata section:
     - Set Level to `040-assistant`
     - Updated API Configuration to use YAML list format instead of JSON
     - Added Categories: Knowledge Management, Documentation
     - Added explicit Reports To and Escalates To relationships

5. **Review for Completeness**
   - Verified all sections from the template are present
   - Confirmed proper formatting of metadata sections according to final conventions
   - No ambiguous or missing critical information identified
