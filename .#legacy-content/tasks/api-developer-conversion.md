# Task Log: api-developer-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the API Developer mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/api-developer.md` and migrate it to the appropriate location following the v7.0 conventions.

**Subject:** API Developer mode file migration
**Audience:** Roo Mode System maintainers
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent organization and formatting of mode files in the v7.0 structure
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/api-developer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_conventions_refinement.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_format_confirmation.md`

## Initial Analysis

Based on the mode classification guides, the API Developer mode is classified as:
- **Level:** 032-worker-backend
- **Department:** Backend
- **Primary Function:** Executing specific implementation tasks related to API development

According to the folder structure guide, the target location should be:
`v7.0/modes/03x-worker/032-backend/api-developer/032_api-developer.mode.md`

## Process Steps

1. Review source mode file `v7.0/modes/md/api-developer.md`
2. Determine correct target folder and filename
## Implementation

1. Created the target folder structure: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/032-backend/api-developer/`
2. Created the mode file: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/032-backend/api-developer/032_api-developer.mode.md`
3. Updated the mode file content according to the template and conventions:
   - Set the Level to `032-worker-backend`
   - Used standard YAML list syntax for tags and tool groups (no backticks or quotes)
   - Removed any model_selection block
   - Maintained all the original content from the source file
   - Organized the metadata section according to the template

## Outcome

The API Developer mode has been successfully migrated to the v7.0 structure:

- **Source file:** `v7.0/modes/md/api-developer.md`
- **Target file:** `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/032-backend/api-developer/032_api-developer.mode.md`

The mode is properly classified as a backend worker (Level 3) and follows all the refined conventions from the decision records.
