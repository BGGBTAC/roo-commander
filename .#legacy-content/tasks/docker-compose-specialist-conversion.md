# Task Log: docker-compose-specialist-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process and migrate the Docker Compose Specialist mode file to the v7.0 structure
**Subject:** Docker Compose Specialist mode file migration
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Standardize mode file format according to v7.0 conventions
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/docker-compose-specialist.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_format_confirmation.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_conventions_refinement.md`

## Process

1. Reviewed source mode file `v7.0/modes/md/docker-compose-specialist.md`
2. Determined classification:
   - Level: Worker (03x)
   - Department: DevOps (035)
   - Department shortcode: do
3. Determined target location:
   - Folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/035-devops/docker-compose-specialist/`
   - Filename: `035-work-do-docker-compose-specialist.mode.md`
4. Identified metadata updates needed:
   - Add Level: "035-worker-devops"
   - Format API Configuration as simple YAML list
   - Ensure Tags and Tool Groups use standard YAML list format
   - Add appropriate Categories

## Implementation

1. Created task log file `project_journal/tasks/docker-compose-specialist-conversion.md`
2. Created target directory `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/035-devops/docker-compose-specialist/`
3. Created new mode file with updated metadata and formatting:
   - Set Level to "035-worker-devops"
   - Added Categories: ["DevOps", "Containerization", "Infrastructure"]
   - Added Stack items
   - Added Reports To entries
   - Formatted API Configuration as simple YAML list
   - Formatted Tags and Tool Groups as standard YAML lists
4. Saved the file to `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/035-devops/docker-compose-specialist/035-work-do-docker-compose-specialist.mode.md`
5. Deleted the original source file `v7.0/modes/md/docker-compose-specialist.md`

## Changes Made

1. Added missing metadata:
   - Level: "035-worker-devops"
   - Categories: ["DevOps", "Containerization", "Infrastructure"]
   - Stack: ["Docker", "Docker Compose", "Kubernetes", "Nomad"]
   - Reports To: ["roo-commander", "project-manager"]
2. Reformatted API Configuration from JSON to YAML list format
3. Applied hyphenated, lowercase filename convention
