# Task Log: second-opinion-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process and migrate the `second-opinion.md` mode file to the v7.0 structure
**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file organization and metadata according to v7.0 conventions
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/second-opinion.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the source file and reference documentation, I've determined:

1. **Mode Classification**: The Second Opinion mode functions as a cross-functional worker that evaluates solutions, designs, and code. It provides critical assessment and alternative approaches.

2. **Appropriate Level**: Based on the classification guide, this mode fits into the `039-worker-cross-functional` category as it:
   - Executes specific evaluation tasks
   - Provides cross-cutting support across multiple domains
   - Focuses on quality assurance and decision support

3. **Target Location**: Following the folder structure guide, the mode should be placed at:
   `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/second-opinion/039-work-xf-second-opinion.mode.md`

4. **Required Updates**:
   - Create the appropriate directory structure
   - Format the filename according to the convention: `[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md`
   - Update metadata section with Level, Categories, DelegatesTo, EscalatesTo, and ReportsTo fields
   - Format API Configuration as a YAML list

## Implementation

The following changes were made to the mode file:

1. **Directory Structure**: Created the directory path:
   `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/second-opinion/`

2. **Filename Convention**: Applied the hyphenated, lowercase convention:
   `039-work-xf-second-opinion.mode.md`

3. **Metadata Updates**:
   - Added Level: `039-worker-cross-functional`
   - Added Categories: `["Cross-Functional", "Quality Assurance"]`
   - Added Stack: `["Evaluation Frameworks", "Technical Analysis", "Critical Thinking"]`
   - Added DelegatesTo: `["technical-writer"]`
   - Added EscalatesTo: `["technical-architect", "code-reviewer", "security-specialist"]`
   - Added ReportsTo: `["roo-commander", "project-manager", "technical-architect"]`
   - Reformatted API Configuration as a YAML list: `- model: quasar-alpha`

4. **Source File Cleanup**: Deleted the original source file:
   `v7.0/modes/md/second-opinion.md`

---

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully migrated the Second Opinion mode to the v7.0 structure. Created the appropriate directory structure, renamed the file according to the convention, and updated the metadata section with all required fields. The mode is now properly classified as a cross-functional worker (039) and follows the final conventions. The original source file has been deleted.
