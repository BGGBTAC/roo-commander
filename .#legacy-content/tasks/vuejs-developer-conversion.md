# Task Log: vuejs-developer-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the Vue.js Developer mode file from v7.0/modes/md/ to the appropriate location following the v7.0 conventions
**Subject:** Vue.js Developer mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo Mode System maintainers
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file organization and formatting according to v7.0 standards
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/vuejs-developer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_format_confirmation.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_conventions_refinement.md`

## Initial Analysis

The Vue.js Developer mode is a frontend worker mode that specializes in building applications using the Vue.js framework. Based on the mode hierarchy and classification guides:

- **Level:** 031-worker-frontend
- **Department Shortcode:** fe (frontend)
- **Mode Slug:** vuejs-developer

According to the final conventions, the mode file should be named using the pattern `[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md` in all lowercase with hyphens.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed source file `v7.0/modes/md/vuejs-developer.md` for completeness and clarity.
2. Determined the correct target location: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/vuejs-developer/031-work-fe-vuejs-developer.mode.md`
3. Created the target directory: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/vuejs-developer/`
4. Created the new mode file with updated metadata and formatting:
   - Added the `Level` field with value `031-worker-frontend`
   - Added the `Categories` field with appropriate categories
   - Added the `Stack` field with relevant technologies
   - Added the `Reports To` field with appropriate reporting relationships
   - Updated the API Configuration format to use the simple YAML list format
   - Added a "Key Considerations / Safety Protocols" section that was missing in the original file
   - Ensured all metadata uses the standard YAML list format without quotes or backticks
5. Verified the content for completeness and adherence to the conventions.

## Missing or Ambiguous Information

No critical information was missing from the source file. All required sections were present and have been properly migrated to the new format.
