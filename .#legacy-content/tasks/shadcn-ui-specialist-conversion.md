# Task Log: shadcn-ui-specialist-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the `shadcn-ui-specialist.md` mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/` according to the final v7.0 conventions.
**Subject:** Shadcn UI Specialist mode file migration
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file organization and metadata according to v7.0 standards
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/shadcn-ui-specialist.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the source file and reference documents, I've determined:

1. **Classification:** The Shadcn UI Specialist is a worker-level mode focused on frontend development with the Shadcn UI library. It should be classified as a `031-worker-frontend` mode.

2. **Target Location:** 
   - Folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/shadcn-ui-specialist/`
   - Filename: `031-work-fe-shadcn-ui-specialist.mode.md` (following the hyphenated convention)

3. **Metadata Updates Needed:**
   - Add `Level: 031-worker-frontend`
   - Format the API Configuration as a YAML list
   - Ensure Tags, Categories, and other metadata follow the standard format

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Check if the target folder exists and create it if needed
2. ✅ Create the new mode file with updated metadata
3. ✅ Optionally delete the original source file

## Implementation Results

The Shadcn UI Specialist mode has been successfully migrated to the new location following the v7.0 conventions:

1. **Classification:** Classified as a `031-worker-frontend` mode based on its focus on frontend development with Shadcn UI components.

2. **Target Location:**
   - Created folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/shadcn-ui-specialist/`
   - Created file: `031-work-fe-shadcn-ui-specialist.mode.md` (following the hyphenated convention)

3. **Metadata Updates:**
   - Added `Level: 031-worker-frontend`
   - Formatted the API Configuration as a YAML list
   - Added appropriate Categories, Stack, DelegatesTo, EscalatesTo, and ReportsTo fields
   - Maintained all original content and structure

4. **Content Structure:**
   - Preserved all original sections (Description, Capabilities, Workflow, etc.)
   - Maintained the Knowledge Base / Context section with Shadcn UI documentation
   - Ensured all formatting follows the standard conventions
