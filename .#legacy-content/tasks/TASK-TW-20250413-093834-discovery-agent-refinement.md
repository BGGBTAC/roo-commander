## Completion Summary
The Discovery Agent mode file has been reviewed and updated according to the v7 standards. All sections are present and properly formatted. The emoji (üîç) has been verified. The core content (Description, Capabilities, Workflow, Role Definition) was already accurate and detailed.

The main update was adding content to section 6 (Context / Knowledge Base), which was previously marked as not present in v6.3. Three potential `.roo/context/discovery-agent/` files were identified:
1. `tech-stack-indicators.md`: For detecting technology stacks based on file patterns
2. `requirements-templates.md`: Templates for requirements gathering across different project types
3. `question-bank.md`: Curated questions for requirements elicitation

All metadata fields were validated and found to be appropriate for this mode:
- Level: 040-assistant (matches directory structure)
- Delegates To: none (appropriate for an assistant mode)
- Escalates To: technical-architect, complex-problem-solver
- Reports To: project-onboarding, roo-commander
- API Configuration: gemini-2.5-pro (standard)
