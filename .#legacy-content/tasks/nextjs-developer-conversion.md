**Subject:** NextJS Developer mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo Mode System maintainers and developers
**Purpose:** Document the process of migrating the NextJS Developer mode to the v7.0 folder structure and format conventions
**References:** 
- Source file: `v7.0/modes/md/nextjs-developer.md`
- Mode template: `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- Hierarchy guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- Folder structure guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- Classification guide: `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- Final Convention ADR: `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`
- File Format ADR: `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_format_confirmation.md`

## Process Steps

1. **Review Source File**
   - Reviewed `v7.0/modes/md/nextjs-developer.md` to understand the mode's purpose, capabilities, and metadata.
   - Identified NextJS Developer as a frontend worker-level mode based on its focus on building web applications using Next.js.

2. **Determine Target Location**
   - Based on the mode classification guide, NextJS Developer is a worker-level mode (Level 3) in the frontend department.
   - Target folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/nextjs-developer/`
   - Target filename: `031-work-fe-nextjs-developer.mode.md` (following the hyphenated convention from the final refinement ADR)

3. **Create Target Folder**
   - Created the folder `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/nextjs-developer/`

4. **Create Updated Mode File**
   - Created the file `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/nextjs-developer/031-work-fe-nextjs-developer.mode.md`
   - Maintained all original content from the source file
   - Added missing metadata fields according to the template:
     - Added `Level: 031-worker-frontend`
     - Added `Categories: Frontend, Backend, Fullstack`
     - Added `Stack: Next.js, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vercel`
     - Added `Delegates To` section with appropriate modes
     - Added `Reports To` section with appropriate modes
     - Updated API Configuration format to use simple YAML list format

5. **Verify Compliance with Conventions**
   - Ensured the file follows the correct structure according to the mode template
   - Verified that the metadata section includes all required fields
   - Confirmed that the API Configuration uses the simple YAML list format as specified in the final convention ADR
   - Verified that the filename follows the hyphenated convention: `[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md`

6. **Optional: Delete Original Source File**
   - The original source file `v7.0/modes/md/nextjs-developer.md` can now be deleted as it has been successfully migrated.
