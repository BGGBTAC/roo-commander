2. Added detailed content to Section 6 (Context / Knowledge Base) with common bug patterns and debugging strategies.
3. Standardized API Configuration to use `gemini-2.5-pro` instead of `quasar-alpha`.
4. Identified potential `.roo/context/bug-fixer/` needs:
   - `.roo/context/bug-fixer/common-patterns.md` for language-specific debugging techniques and common bug patterns
   - `.roo/context/bug-fixer/debugging-tools.md` for references to debugging tools across different environments
