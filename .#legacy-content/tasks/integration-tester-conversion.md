# Task Log: integration-tester-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the integration-tester mode file according to v7.0 conventions
**Subject:** Mode file migration for integration-tester
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Standardize mode file format and location according to v7.0 conventions
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/integration-tester.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Process Steps

1. **Review Source File**
   - Reviewed `v7.0/modes/md/integration-tester.md` to understand content and structure
   - Identified as a QA worker mode (Level: 034-worker-qa)

2. **Determine Target Location**
   - Based on hierarchy guide: Level 3 Worker (03x-worker)
   - Department: QA (034-qa)
   - Target folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/034-qa/integration-tester/`
   - Target filename: `034-work-qa-integration-tester.mode.md` (using hyphenated convention)

3. **Create Target Structure**
   - Verified 034-qa folder exists
   - Created integration-tester subfolder

4. **Process Mode File**
   - Copied content from source file
   - Updated metadata section with:
     - Level: 034-worker-qa
     - Added Categories: QA, Testing
     - Added Stack: pytest, jest, postman, newman, pact, testing-library
     - Added Delegates To: bug-fixer
     - Added Escalates To: bug-fixer, cicd-specialist, infrastructure-specialist, api-developer, frontend-developer, technical-architect
     - Added Reports To: cicd-specialist, project-manager, roo-commander
     - Updated API Configuration format to use simple YAML list format
   - Saved to target location: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/034-qa/integration-tester/034-work-qa-integration-tester.mode.md`

5. **Final Steps**
   - The mode file has been successfully migrated to the new location with updated metadata
   - Deleted the original source file `v7.0/modes/md/integration-tester.md`

## Notes on Metadata Updates

- Added missing metadata fields based on the mode's content and role
- Used department shortcode "qa" in the filename
- Formatted API Configuration according to the final convention ADR
- Identified collaboration relationships from the Custom Instructions section to populate Delegates To, Escalates To, and Reports To fields
