# Task Log: TASK-MODE-20251204-184100 - v7.0 Mode Consistency & Completion

**Goal:** Ensure consistency and completeness across the v7.0 mode set based on the findings in `project_journal/reviews/20251204-v7.0-mode-review.md`.

**Status:** âœ… Complete

**Coordinator:** TASK-CMD-20251204-184100 (Placeholder ID for this Commander task)

**Assigned To:** mode-maintainer (Processing delegated to technical-writer)

---
**Log:**
*   `2025-12-04 20:09:17`: Technical Writer started processing task. Reviewing context files.
*   `2025-12-04 20:17:08`: Reviewed findings (`project_journal/reviews/20251204-v7.0-mode-review.md`). Key areas: Complete Lead modes, standardize API config/optional sections, verify delegation lists, review new/converted Worker/Assistant modes.
---
**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   All Lead mode templates (`02x-lead/*`) are fully populated with detailed Capabilities, Custom Instructions (Workflow, Collaboration, Error Handling, etc.), and complete Metadata (Tool Groups, Stack, Delegation/Escalation/Reporting lists, API Config).
*   API Configuration (`model`) is standardized across all modes (defaulting to `gemini-2.5-pro` unless a specific reason exists and is documented).
*   Optional sections (e.g., "Key Considerations / Safety Protocols", "Context / Knowledge Base") are consistently present in all modes (potentially with placeholder content if not immediately applicable).
*   Delegation, Escalation, and Reporting lists in all modes are verified and updated based on the final v7.0 mode set and naming conventions.
*   Knowledge Base source file references (like in `react-specialist`) are either validated or a standard approach is documented/implemented.
*   Newly added Worker/Assistant modes are reviewed and brought up to the standard level of completeness.
*   Converted Worker modes are reviewed for consistency.

**Context Files:**
*   `project_journal/reviews/20251204-v7.0-mode-review.md`
*   `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
*   `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
*   All files within `v7.0/modes/`
