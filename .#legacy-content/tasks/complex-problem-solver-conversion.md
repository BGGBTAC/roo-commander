# Task Log: complex-problem-solver-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the complex-problem-solver mode file according to v7.0 conventions
**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file organization and metadata
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/complex-problem-solver.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md` (template)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md` (hierarchy guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md` (folder structure guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md` (classification guide)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md` (final conventions)

## Analysis

After reviewing the source file and the classification guides, I've determined:

1. **Mode Classification:**
   - The complex-problem-solver analyzes technical problems across multiple domains
   - It provides recommendations but doesn't implement solutions
   - It works with code, logs, architecture, and other technical aspects
   - Based on its function, it fits as a **worker-level** mode
   - Since it works across multiple technical domains, it's classified as **cross-functional**

2. **Target Classification:**
   - **Level:** 039-worker-cross-functional
   - **Department Shortcode:** xf (cross-functional)
   - **Target Folder:** `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/complex-problem-solver/`
   - **Target Filename:** `039-work-xf-complex-problem-solver.mode.md`

3. **Metadata Updates Needed:**
   - Add **Level** field: `039-worker-cross-functional`
   - Update **API Configuration** format to YAML list style
   - Add **Categories** field (not present in source)
   - Add **Stack** field (not present in source)
   - Ensure all other metadata follows the template format

## Implementation

1. **Created Directory Structure:**
   - Created the directory: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/complex-problem-solver/`

2. **Created Updated Mode File:**
   - Created the file: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/complex-problem-solver/039-work-xf-complex-problem-solver.mode.md`
   - Maintained all original content from the source file
   - Added the missing metadata fields:
     - Level: `039-worker-cross-functional`
     - Categories: `Cross-Functional`, `Analysis`, `Problem-Solving`
     - Stack: `General`, `Debugging`, `Analysis`
   - Updated the API Configuration format to use YAML list style

3. **Cleanup:**
   - Deleted the original source file: `v7.0/modes/md/complex-problem-solver.md`

---

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully processed the complex-problem-solver mode file according to v7.0 conventions. Created the appropriate directory structure, renamed the file using the hyphenated convention, updated the metadata according to the template, and deleted the original source file.
