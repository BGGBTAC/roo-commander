# Task Log: containerization-developer-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode Migration

**Goal:** Process the containerization-developer mode file according to v7.0 conventions
**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file structure and organization
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/containerization-developer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md` (template)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md` (hierarchy guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md` (folder structure guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md` (classification guide)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md` (final conventions)

## Initial Analysis

Based on the mode's description and capabilities, the containerization-developer mode is classified as:
- **Level:** `035-worker-devops` (Worker level, DevOps department)
- **Department Shortcode:** `do` (DevOps)
- **Target Folder:** `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/035-devops/containerization-developer/`
- **Target Filename:** `035-work-do-containerization-developer.mode.md`

The mode focuses on designing, building, securing, and managing containerized applications using Docker, Kubernetes, Swarm, and Nomad, which clearly places it in the DevOps worker category.

## Implementation Steps

1. Checked if the target directory exists
2. Created the containerization-developer directory as it didn't exist
3. Created the new mode file with updated metadata and formatting
4. Key changes made:
   - Added Level field: `035-worker-devops`
   - Updated API Configuration format from JSON to YAML list
   - Added Categories: DevOps, Infrastructure
   - Maintained all original content and capabilities
   - Formatted according to the v7.0 conventions

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully migrated the containerization-developer mode to the v7.0 structure with proper metadata and formatting.
