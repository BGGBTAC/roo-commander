# Task Log: research-context-builder-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the `research-context-builder.md` mode file according to v7.0 conventions
**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo mode system maintainers
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file organization and metadata
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/research-context-builder.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the source file `v7.0/modes/md/research-context-builder.md`, I've determined:

1. **Mode Classification:** Based on the mode's primary function as an information gatherer and synthesizer that provides research support to other modes, it best fits as an **Assistant** mode (Level 4).

2. **Missing Metadata:** The source file is missing several metadata fields:
   - Level (should be `040-assistant`)
   - Categories
   - Stack
   - DelegatesTo
   - EscalatesTo
   - ReportsTo

3. **Target Location:** According to the folder structure guide, this mode should be placed in:
   `v7.0/modes/040-assistant/research-context-builder/040-asst-research-context-builder.mode.md`

## Processing Steps

1. **Created Target Directory:**
   - Created the directory `v7.0/modes/040-assistant/research-context-builder/`

2. **Updated Mode File:**
   - Created the new mode file with the correct filename convention: `040-asst-research-context-builder.mode.md`
   - Maintained all existing content from the source file
   - Updated the metadata section with the following additions:
     - **Level:** `040-assistant`
     - **Categories:** Added `Information Gathering`, `Research`, `Documentation`
     - **Stack:** Marked as `[N/A]` as not specified in source
     - **DelegatesTo:** Marked as `[N/A]` as not specified in source
     - **EscalatesTo:** Added `complex-problem-solver`, `technical-architect`, and `context-condenser` based on the collaboration section
     - **ReportsTo:** Set as `[Delegating mode]` as this would depend on which mode initiates the task
   - Updated the API Configuration format to use the simple YAML list format per the final convention refinement

3. **Metadata Format Updates:**
   - Used hyphenated, lowercase convention for the filename
   - Used simple YAML list format for API Configuration
   - Used standard list format for all metadata fields

4. **Source File Cleanup:**
   - Deleted the original source file `v7.0/modes/md/research-context-builder.md`

## Flagged Issues

1. **Ambiguous Reporting Structure:** The mode doesn't explicitly specify which modes it reports to. This has been set generically as "[Delegating mode]" but may need further clarification.

2. **Missing Stack Information:** No specific technology stack is mentioned for this mode, which is reasonable given its research-focused nature.

---
**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully migrated the Research & Context Builder mode to the v7.0 structure. Created the appropriate directory, renamed the file using the hyphenated convention, updated the metadata according to the final conventions, and deleted the original source file.
