# Task Log: supabase-developer-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process and migrate the `supabase-developer.md` mode file to the v7.0 folder structure with updated conventions
**Subject:** Supabase Developer mode file migration
**Audience:** Roo Commander development team
**Purpose:** Standardize mode file format and location according to v7.0 conventions
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/supabase-developer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Process

1. Reviewed the source file `v7.0/modes/md/supabase-developer.md`
2. Analyzed the mode to determine appropriate classification:
   - **Level:** `032-worker-backend` (Worker level, Backend department)
   - **Department Shortcode:** `be`
   - **Mode Slug:** `supabase-developer`
3. Determined target location:
   - **Target Folder:** `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/032-backend/supabase-developer/`
   - **Target Filename:** `032-work-be-supabase-developer.mode.md`
4. Identified missing metadata in source file:
   - Level (needs to be set to `032-worker-backend`)
   - Categories (needs to include `["Backend", "Database"]`)
   - Stack (needs to be defined)
   - DelegatesTo, EscalatesTo, ReportsTo relationships (need to be defined based on collaboration section)
5. Created the target folder structure:
   ```
   v7.0/modes/03x-worker/032-backend/supabase-developer/
   ```
6. Created the mode file with updated metadata and formatting:
   - Added Level: `032-worker-backend`
   - Added Categories: `Backend`, `Database`, `API`, `Authentication`, `Serverless`
   - Added Stack: `Supabase`, `PostgreSQL`, `TypeScript`, `Deno`, `JavaScript`
   - Added DelegatesTo relationships based on collaboration section
   - Added EscalatesTo relationships based on escalation points
   - Added ReportsTo relationships
   - Updated API Configuration format to use YAML list format
   - Added missing Key Considerations / Safety Protocols section
   - Enhanced Error Handling section
