# Task Log: clerk-auth-specialist-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode Migration

**Goal:** Process the `clerk-auth-specialist.md` mode file from `v7.0/modes/md/` according to the final conventions.
**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file structure and organization
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/clerk-auth-specialist.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md` (template)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md` (hierarchy guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md` (folder structure guide)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md` (classification guide)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md` (final conventions)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_format_confirmation.md` (format confirmation)
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_file_conventions_refinement.md` (conventions refinement)

## Initial Analysis

### Source File Review
The `clerk-auth-specialist.md` file contains a mode definition for a specialist focused on implementing Clerk authentication and user management in web applications. The mode includes capabilities for frontend/backend integration, route protection, session handling, and advanced features.

### Classification Determination
Based on the mode classification guide:
- **Level:** This is a worker-level mode (03x-worker) as it executes specific implementation tasks focused on a particular technology (Clerk authentication).
- **Department:** While it spans both frontend and backend, its primary focus is on frontend integration (components, hooks, UI customization) with backend support. Classified as `031-worker-frontend`.
- **Department Shortcode:** `fe` (frontend)

### Target Location
According to the folder structure guide, the mode should be placed in:
`v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/clerk-auth-specialist/`

### Target Filename
According to the final convention refinement, the filename should follow the pattern:
`[level_prefix]-[department_shortcode]-[mode_slug].mode.md`

Therefore, the target filename will be:
`031-work-fe-clerk-auth-specialist.mode.md`

## Missing Information
The source file has several metadata fields marked with placeholders:
- Level: [level] - Will be set to "031-worker-frontend"
- Categories: [category] - Will be set to ["Frontend", "Security", "Authentication"]
- Stack: [stack] - Will be set to ["Clerk", "Next.js", "React", "Remix", "Expo"]
- Delegates To: [delegatesTo] - Will be left empty as no specific delegation targets are mentioned
- Reports To: [reportsTo] - Will be set to ["frontend-lead", "project-manager"]

## Implementation Plan
1. Create the target directory structure
2. Copy the source file to the target location with the correct filename
3. Update the metadata fields according to the template and conventions
4. Flag any ambiguous or missing critical information
5. Optionally delete the source file after successful processing

## Implementation

### Directory Creation
Created the target directory:
```
v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/clerk-auth-specialist/
```

### File Creation
Created the target file with updated metadata:
```
v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/clerk-auth-specialist/031-work-fe-clerk-auth-specialist.mode.md
```

### Metadata Updates
The following metadata fields were updated:
- **Level:** Set to "031-worker-frontend"
- **Tool Groups:** Formatted as standard YAML list (no backticks/quotes)
- **Tags:** Formatted as standard YAML list (no backticks/quotes)
- **Categories:** Set to ["Frontend", "Security", "Authentication"]
- **Stack:** Set to ["Clerk", "Next.js", "React", "Remix", "Expo"]
- **Delegates To:** Left empty as no specific delegation targets are mentioned
- **Reports To:** Set to ["frontend-lead", "project-manager"]
- **API Configuration:** Updated to use simple YAML list format

### Notes on Ambiguities/Missing Information
- The mode spans both frontend and backend responsibilities but was classified as frontend-focused based on its primary emphasis on frontend components and hooks.
- The "Reports To" field was set based on the hierarchical structure, assuming the mode would report to both the frontend lead and project manager.
- The "Stack" field was populated based on technologies mentioned in the mode description and tags.

### Source File Cleanup
Deleted the original source file:
```
v7.0/modes/md/clerk-auth-specialist.md
```

---

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully processed the `clerk-auth-specialist.md` mode file according to the final conventions. Created the appropriate directory structure, renamed the file using the hyphenated convention, and updated all metadata fields to comply with the standardized format. The mode was classified as a frontend worker (031-worker-frontend) with cross-functional capabilities for authentication and security. The original source file was deleted after successful processing.
