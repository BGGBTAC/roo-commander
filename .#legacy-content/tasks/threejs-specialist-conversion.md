- Mode name and slug
- Description, capabilities, and workflow
- Role definition
- Custom instructions with operational principles, workflow steps, collaboration guidelines, etc.
- Metadata section with some placeholders

### 2. Determine Classification
Based on the mode classification guide:
- This is a worker-level mode (Level 3) as it executes specific implementation tasks
- It focuses on frontend development (Three.js is a JavaScript library for web-based 3D graphics)
- Appropriate classification: `031-worker-frontend`
- Department shortcode: `fe`

### 3. Determine Target Location
According to the folder structure guide:
- Base path: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/threejs-specialist/`
- Filename: `031-work-fe-threejs-specialist.mode.md` (following the hyphenated convention from the final refinement ADR)

### 4. Process Mode File
- Created the target directory: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/threejs-specialist/`
- Created the mode file with updated metadata:
  - Set Level to `031-worker-frontend`
  - Updated API Configuration to use simple YAML list format
  - Added appropriate Categories and Stack items
  - Added appropriate Delegates To, Escalates To, and Reports To entries
  - Maintained all original content from the source file

### 5. Clean Up

### 6. Completion
- Successfully created the mode file at `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/threejs-specialist/031-work-fe-threejs-specialist.mode.md`
