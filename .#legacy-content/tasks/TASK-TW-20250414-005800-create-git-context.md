# Task Log: TASK-TW-20250414-005800-create-git-context - Technical Writing: `.roo/context/git-manager/git-commands.md`

**Goal:** Create/Update documentation: `.roo/context/git-manager/git-commands.md`
**Subject:** Git commands reference for the git-manager mode
**Audience:** Git Manager mode and users interacting with it
**Purpose:** Provide a comprehensive reference of Git commands, syntax, and options relevant to the git-manager's workflow
**References:** 
- `.tasks/TASK-TW-20250414-005800-create-git-context.md`
- `.planning/context_file_creation_plan.md`
- `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/git-manager/039-work-xf-git-manager.mode.md`

## Initial Research and Planning

I'll be researching common Git commands and their options, focusing on those most relevant to the git-manager mode's responsibilities. The reference will include syntax, important options, and practical use cases.

Key commands to cover:
- Basic operations: status, add, commit
- Branch management: branch, checkout, switch
- Integration: merge, rebase
- Remote operations: push, pull, fetch, remote
- History and inspection: log, diff, show
- Advanced operations: stash, cherry-pick, reset, revert

Each command section will include:
1. Basic syntax
2. Common options with explanations
3. Practical examples
4. Safety considerations where applicable
