     - Target folder: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/035-devops/cicd-specialist/`
     - Target filename: `035-work-do-cicd-specialist.mode.md`

3. **Create Target Folder Structure**
   - Created the `035-devops` directory in the `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/` path
   - Created the `cicd-specialist` subdirectory

4. **Update and Migrate Mode File**
