**Goal:** Process and migrate the `file-repair-specialist.md` mode file to the v7.0 folder structure with updated conventions.
**Subject:** Mode file migration and standardization
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent mode file organization and metadata format
**References:**

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the source file and reference documents, I've determined:

1. **Mode Classification:** The file-repair-specialist is a Level 4: `040-assistant` mode
2. **Department Shortcode:** "asst" (for assistant modes)
3. **Target Location:** 
   - Folder: `v7.0/modes/040-assistant/file-repair-specialist/`
   - Filename: `040-asst-file-repair-specialist.mode.md` (using hyphenated, lowercase convention)

## Metadata Updates Required

The following updates are needed for the metadata section:
- Update the Level field to "040-assistant"
- Format the Tool Groups as a YAML list with hyphens
- Format the Tags as a YAML list with hyphens
- Format the API Configuration as a YAML list with hyphens
