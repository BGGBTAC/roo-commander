# Task Log: mode-maintainer-conversion - Technical Writing: Mode File Migration

**Goal:** Process the mode file `v7.0/modes/md/mode-maintainer.md` according to the v7.0 conventions
**Subject:** Mode Maintainer mode file migration
**Audience:** Roo development team
**Purpose:** Standardize mode file format and organization according to v7.0 conventions
**References:** 
- `v7.0/modes/md/mode-maintainer.md` (source file)
- `v7.0/templates/mode_hierarchy.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_folder_structure.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_classification_guide.md`
- `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md`
- `project_journal/decisions/20251104-mode_convention_final_refinement.md`

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the source file and reference materials, I've determined:

1. **Mode Classification:** The Mode Maintainer appears to be a cross-functional worker mode that executes specific tasks related to mode file maintenance.
   - **Level:** `039-worker-cross-functional`
   - **Department Shortcode:** `xf` (cross-functional)

2. **Target Location:**
   - **Folder Path:** `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/mode-maintainer/`
   - **Filename:** `039-work-xf-mode-maintainer.mode.md`

3. **Metadata Updates Needed:**
   - Add proper Level field: `039-worker-cross-functional`
   - Format API Configuration as YAML list
   - Add Categories field: `["Cross-Functional", "Meta-Programming", "Configuration"]`
   - Update Stack field (currently missing)
   - Update DelegatesTo field (currently missing)
   - Ensure proper format for Tags, EscalatesTo, and ReportsTo fields

## Process Steps

1. ✅ Created task log file `project_journal/tasks/mode-maintainer-conversion.md`
2. ✅ Created target directory `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/mode-maintainer/`
3. ✅ Created new mode file with updated content at `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/mode-maintainer/039-work-xf-mode-maintainer.mode.md`
4. ✅ Deleted original source file `v7.0/modes/md/mode-maintainer.md`

## Metadata Updates

The following updates were made to the mode file metadata:

1. **Added Level field:** `039-worker-cross-functional`
2. **Formatted API Configuration as YAML list:**
   ```markdown
   **API Configuration:**
   - model: gemini-2.5-pro
   ```
3. **Added Categories field:**
   ```markdown
   **Categories:**
   - Cross-Functional
   - Meta-Programming
   - Configuration
   ```
4. **Added Stack field:**
   ```markdown
   **Stack:**
   - JSON
   - Markdown
   - Mode System
   ```
5. **Updated DelegatesTo field:**
   ```markdown
   **Delegates To:**
   - None
   ```
6. **Standardized format for Tags, EscalatesTo, and ReportsTo fields**

## Content Enhancements

1. **Added Key Considerations / Safety Protocols section:**
   ```markdown
   ### 4. Key Considerations / Safety Protocols
   *   Always validate JSON structure before saving to prevent corrupting mode files
   *   Maintain complete backups of original files before making changes
   *   Ensure all required fields remain present in the modified JSON
   *   Follow established naming conventions and formatting standards
   *   Test changes in a non-production environment when possible
   ```

2. **Added Context / Knowledge Base section:**
   ```markdown
   ### 6. Context / Knowledge Base (Optional)
   *   JSON structure and validation principles
   *   Roo mode file format specifications
   *   Common mode file modification patterns
   *   Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for mode maintenance
   ```

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully migrated the Mode Maintainer mode file to the v7.0 format and structure. Created the new file at `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/039-cross-functional/mode-maintainer/039-work-xf-mode-maintainer.mode.md` with updated metadata and enhanced content sections. Deleted the original source file after successful migration.
