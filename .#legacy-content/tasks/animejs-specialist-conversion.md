## Process Log

### 1. Source File Review

The source file `v7.0/modes/md/animejs-specialist.md` contains:
- Mode name: "✨ anime.js Specialist"
- Mode slug: "animejs-specialist"

- Capabilities and workflow sections
- Role definition
- Custom instructions with sections on expertise, operational principles, workflow, collaboration, key considerations, error handling, and knowledge base
- Metadata including tool groups, tags, escalation paths, and API configuration

### 2. Mode Classification Analysis

Based on the mode classification guide:
- **Level determination**: This mode's primary function is executing specific implementation tasks focused on anime.js animations, which places it at the **`03x-worker`** level.
- **Department determination**: The mode focuses on frontend development (JavaScript animations, framework integration), placing it in the **`031-worker-frontend`** department.
- **Full level identifier**: `031-worker-frontend`

### 3. Target Location Determination

Following the folder structure guide:
- Base path: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/`
- Mode folder: `animejs-specialist/`
- Target filename: `031_animejs-specialist.mode.md`
- Full target path: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/animejs-specialist/031_animejs-specialist.mode.md`

### 4. Metadata Review and Updates

The following metadata fields need to be updated or added:

### 5. File Creation and Migration

Created the target directory structure and migrated the mode file:
- Created directory: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/animejs-specialist/`
- Created file: `v7.0/modes/03x-worker/031-frontend/animejs-specialist/031_animejs-specialist.mode.md`
