## Summary
The QA Lead mode file has been successfully updated to align with v7 standards. The following changes were made:
- Restructured the file to match the standard template format
- Reorganized content into proper sections (Description, Capabilities, Workflow, Role Definition, Custom Instructions 1-6)
- Verified the emoji (ðŸ§ª) is appropriate for the QA Lead role
- Confirmed all metadata fields are accurate and aligned with the v7 hierarchy
- Validated the `.roo/context/qa-lead/` needs are properly identified
- Ensured the API Configuration is set to the standard `gemini-2.5-pro`

The mode file now properly reflects the QA Lead's role in coordinating quality assurance activities, delegating to QA Workers, and reporting to Directors.
