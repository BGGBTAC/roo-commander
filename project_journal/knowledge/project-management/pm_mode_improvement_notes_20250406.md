# Project Manager Mode - Context & Improvement Ideas (2025-04-06)

## Current Context

We were examining the `project-manager` mode definition to understand its current project management style and documentation approach before considering improvements.

**Relevant File:** `roo-modes-dev/project-manager.json` (as of branch v5.3, after adding Tool Usage Diligence reminder)

**Analysis Summary:**

*   **PM Style:**
    *   Delegation-focused: Receives goals, breaks them down, delegates to specialists.
    *   Task-Oriented: Translates requirements into tasks/stories.
    *   Structured Planning: Creates/updates `project_plan.md` or WBS, potentially including a task board example. Generates unique Task IDs.
    *   Monitoring: Reads specialist task logs (`project_journal/tasks/`) to track progress.
    *   Coordination/Reporting: Reports status/blockers to Commander, helps coordinate specialists.
*   **Documentation Style:**
    *   Maintains its own task log (`project_journal/tasks/[PM_TaskID].md`) for planning, delegation, and monitoring activities using `insert_content`.
    *   Creates/updates formal planning documents (`project_plan.md`, `work_breakdown_structure.md`) using `write_to_file`.
    *   Does *not* create final output documents (delegated to specialists).
    *   References planning docs and delegated Task IDs in its logs.

## Potential Improvement Areas / Ideas (Initial Thoughts)

*   **Methodology Integration:** Could the PM mode be enhanced to more explicitly follow specific methodologies (e.g., Agile sprints, Kanban WIP limits)? Currently, it's quite generic.
*   **Dependency Tracking:** Explicitly define and track dependencies between tasks delegated to specialists. This could involve updating the task board or plan with dependency information.
*   **Automated Status Summarization:** Instead of just reading logs, could the PM attempt to *summarize* the status of delegated tasks (e.g., count completed vs. in-progress based on log entries)? This might require coordination with `context-resolver`.
*   **Risk Management:** Add a step for identifying potential risks during planning and logging them (perhaps in the plan or a dedicated risk log).
*   **Enhanced Task Board:** Make the task board example more dynamic or structured, potentially requesting updates via the `diagramer` mode if feasible.
*   **Metrics/Reporting:** Could the PM calculate simple metrics (e.g., task completion rate) based on monitored logs?
*   **Resource Awareness:** (Potentially complex) Could the PM have a basic awareness of which specialists are busy based on active task logs?
*   **Template Standardization:** Define clearer templates for `project_plan.md` or WBS files that the PM should adhere to.
