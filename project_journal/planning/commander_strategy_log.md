**Context:** Project reaching version 1.0 milestone

**Details:**
The Roo Commander project has officially reached version 1.0. This marks the transition from development to a stable release. The following key updates were made:

1. Updated CHANGELOG.md to move all unreleased changes to version 1.0.0 with today's date
2. Added a new section to README.md with recommended LLM models for specific modes:
   - Second Opinion mode: DeepSeek v3
   - UI Designer mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Tailwind CSS Specialist mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Frontend Developer mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Complex Problem Solver mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7 with thinking enabled

**Rationale:**
After extensive development and testing, the project has reached a level of maturity and stability warranting a 1.0 release. The model recommendations are based on testing and observed performance with different modes.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue gathering feedback on mode performance with different models
- Plan feature enhancements for future versions
- Consider expanding the model recommendations section as more testing is conducted
