**Context:** Project reaching version 1.0 milestone

**Details:**
The Roo Commander project has officially reached version 1.0. This marks the transition from development to a stable release. The following key updates were made:

1. Updated CHANGELOG.md to move all unreleased changes to version 1.0.0 with today's date
2. Added a new section to README.md with recommended LLM models for specific modes:
   - Second Opinion mode: DeepSeek v3
   - UI Designer mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Tailwind CSS Specialist mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Frontend Developer mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Complex Problem Solver mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7 with thinking enabled

**Rationale:**
After extensive development and testing, the project has reached a level of maturity and stability warranting a 1.0 release. The model recommendations are based on testing and observed performance with different modes.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue gathering feedback on mode performance with different models
- Plan feature enhancements for future versions
- Consider expanding the model recommendations section as more testing is conducted

**Context:** Addressing feedback regarding Roo Commander bypassing the management layer and project initialization workflow for new project requests.

**Details:**
Received feedback from the CEO indicating that Roo Commander mode delegated a simple website creation task directly to `code` mode, skipping discovery and management planning. Also noted incorrect addressing ("user" instead of "CEO").

**Decision:**
Update the `customInstructions` for the `roo-commander` mode to:
1. Explicitly mandate following the `project_initialization_workflow.md` for ALL new projects, involving `Discovery Agent` and `Project Initializer`.
2. Reinforce the rule that delegation must flow through the management layer (PM, TA, DevOps) before reaching specialist implementation modes like `code`.
3. Add an instruction to always address the user as "CEO".

**Rationale:**
To ensure Roo Commander adheres to the defined project structure, utilizes the full team effectively, and follows the established planning and documentation protocols. Correct addressing improves the interaction quality.

**Next Steps:**
Delegate the update of `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/roo-commander.json` to the `code` mode with the revised instructions.

**Context:** Refining Roo Commander instructions for new project initiation based on CEO feedback.

**Details:**
Confirmed that `Discovery Agent` and `Project Initializer` modes have self-contained instructions defining their roles. The dependency on explicitly referencing `project_initialization_workflow.md` in Roo Commander's instructions can be removed.

**Decision:**
Update the `customInstructions` for the `roo-commander` mode again to remove the direct file path reference (`project_journal/planning/project_initialization_workflow.md`) while still mandating the *sequence* of using `Discovery Agent` followed by `Project Initializer` for all new project requests.

**Rationale:**
Embeds the workflow logic within the mode instructions themselves, making the system more robust and removing the dependency on an external file being present in the project context.

**Next Steps:**
Delegate the update of `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/roo-commander.json` to the `code` mode with the further revised instructions.
