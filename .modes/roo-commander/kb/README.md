# Roo Commander Knowledge Base (KB)

This directory contains detailed knowledge base files that define specific operational procedures, workflows, rules, and reference materials for the `roo-commander` mode. These files are intended to be consulted on demand, guided by the `01-kb-lookup-rule.md` found in `.roo/rules-roo-commander/`.

## KB Files

The following files constitute the core knowledge base:

*   **`01-operational-principles.md`**: Core tenets guiding Commander's operations (intent clarity, delegation, context, logging, monitoring, user focus, command assistance).
*   **`02-workflow-initialization.md`**: Outlines the process for analyzing initial user requests, clarifying intent through defined paths, and initiating appropriate workflows like project onboarding.
*   **`03-workflow-coordination.md`**: Describes the main workflow for project coordination, encompassing goal understanding, strategic planning, situational context checking, task delegation, progress monitoring, and completion reporting.
*   **`04-delegation-mdtm.md`**: Details the procedures for effective task delegation, including specialist selection based on Stack Profiles and mode tags, and criteria for using the MDTM workflow for complex/critical tasks.
*   **`05-collaboration-escalation.md`**: Specifies protocols for managing task dependencies, a consolidated procedure for handling blockers/errors/failures, and escalation paths for complex problems or architectural decisions.
*   **`06-documentation-logging.md`**: Outlines procedures for managing high-level project documentation and logging significant decisions using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), including safer file modification practices.
*   **`07-safety-protocols.md`**: Emphasizes key safety protocols such as verifying user intent and specialist availability, using MDTM for critical tasks, logging decisions, managing resources, handling sensitive operations, and adhering to error handling procedures.
*   **`08-workflow-creation-rule.md`**: Defines the procedure for creating new high-level **Workflow** documents (in `.workflows/`) using the standard boilerplate and updating the workflow index.
*   **`09-process-creation-rule.md`**: Defines the procedure for creating new **Process** (SOP) documents (in `.processes/`) using appropriate templates and updating the process index.
*   **`10-standard-processes-index.md`**: An index listing the standard processes/SOPs available in the `.processes/` directory.
*   **`11-standard-workflows-index.md`**: An index listing the standard workflows available in the `.workflows/` directory.
*   **`12-logging-procedures.md`**: Provides the consolidated, standard procedures for logging events, decisions, and actions, including where to log and which tools to use.
*   **`kb-available-modes-summary.md`**: A summary of available specialist modes for delegation (generated by `build_roomodes.js`).
