# Custom Mode Improvements Summary (v3 vs. v2)

## Introduction

This document outlines the key changes and improvements made to the custom mode configuration, evolving from the initial `roo-commander-v2.json` (referred to as v2) to the latest refined version (v3). The primary goals of these changes were to enhance **scalability**, **standardization**, **maintainability**, and **context management** for Large Language Models (LLMs) interacting with the project journal.

## Major Changes & Improvements

### 1. Standardized Project Journal Structure

*   **Problem (v2):** Technical notes paths were less defined, and the `roo-commander` relied on a single, ever-growing `commander_strategy_log.md` file for appending strategic notes. This approach lacked scalability and organization.
*   **Solution (v3):**
    *   A **standardized, hierarchical structure** was implemented for all technical notes:
        `project_journal/technical_notes/[mode_slug]/YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_[mode_slug]_brief-topic.md`
    *   This structure is now used by **all modes**, including `roo-commander`, for logging specific events, decisions, or work summaries. Each significant event gets its own timestamped file within a dated folder for that mode.
    *   The single, appending `commander_strategy_log.md` was **removed** in favor of this more granular, structured logging.
    *   Retained separate top-level folders like `project_journal/planning/`, `project_journal/formal_docs/`, and `project_journal/decision_log/` for their specific document types.
*   **Benefit:** Improved organization, scalability (easier to manage many files), searchability, and clearer chronological tracking of actions per mode. Prevents single files from becoming unwieldy.

### 2. Refined `secretary` Mode Role & Permissions

*   **Rationale (v2/v3):** Keeping a dedicated `secretary` mode remains beneficial for centralizing file write operations, enforcing structure, and potentially using a faster/cheaper LLM.
*   **Improvements (v3):**
    *   **Strict Permissions:** Added a `fileRegex` to the `secretary`'s `groups` definition (`"fileRegex": "^project_journal\\/.*\\.md$"`) to *enforce* that it can **only** edit Markdown files strictly within the `project_journal/` directory. This is a significant safety enhancement.
    *   **Clearer Instructions:** Refined the `secretary`'s instructions to emphasize its sole focus on the `write_to_file` tool and accurate path execution, removing ambiguity. Explicitly forbids content analysis or conversation.
    *   **Removed Other Tools:** Removed unnecessary tool groups (`command`, `mcp`, `browser`) from the `secretary` definition to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
*   **Benefit:** Increased security, clearer role definition, and better enforcement of the journaling protocol.

### 3. Requirements Document Handling

*   **Problem (v2):** The `requirements.md` file was treated statically, potentially being overwritten without history.
*   **Solution (v3):**
    *   The `discovery-agent` creates the *initial* `project_journal/planning/requirements.md`.
    *   Instructions now implicitly support an update process where the *current* requirements reside in the main file, but modes initiating updates (like `roo-commander` or `project-manager`) *should* ideally handle archiving the previous version before delegating the overwrite to the `secretary`. (Note: Archiving logic isn't explicitly scripted but implied as best practice).
    *   The *event* of updating requirements is logged in the technical notes of the mode initiating the update.
*   **Benefit:** Better tracking of requirement evolution, ensuring the main file reflects the current state while allowing for historical context (if archiving is implemented).

### 4. Removal of `[project_slug]` Path Component

*   **Change (v3):** Removed the assumption that all `project_journal` interactions would occur within a specific `[project_slug]` subfolder. All paths now reference `project_journal/` directly at the top level (relative to the workspace root or context).
*   **Benefit:** Simplifies path management within the instructions and makes the structure more general, assuming Roo operates within a specific project context where `project_journal` is directly accessible.

## Other Changes & Refinements

*   **Mode Pruning:** Removed modes not directly related to the core "website building" focus (e.g., Agentic AI Developer, RAG Database Developer, specific LLM API developers, MCP Creators) as requested.
*   **JSON Validity:** Corrected minor JSON syntax errors (e.g., missing commas between array elements in `groups`).
*   **Instruction Conciseness:** Minor edits were made across various modes to slightly reduce instruction length while retaining critical protocols (delegation, journaling format, completion reporting).
*   **Removed `apiConfiguration`:** As requested for the final output, the `apiConfiguration` block was removed from all modes, allowing users to configure this separately.

## Supporting the LLM Contextualization Goal

The core reason for these journaling improvements is to create a rich, structured history that aids LLM context management:

1.  **Granularity:** Timestamped files for each mode's actions allow an LLM (or a retrieval system) to pinpoint exactly what happened when.
2.  **Organization:** Grouping notes by mode and date makes it easier to trace the activities of specific specialists or reconstruct events within a timeframe.
3.  **Traceability:** The protocol requiring modes to reference source documents (requirements, architecture, prior notes) in their *own* notes helps build links, allowing an LLM to follow the chain of reasoning or dependencies.
4.  **Structured Content:** Using a consistent Markdown format within notes (Timestamp, Mode, Event, Context, Details) provides machine-readable structure that can potentially be parsed for context injection.
5.  **Separation of Concerns:** Keeping high-level formal docs separate from detailed technical notes allows focusing context retrieval (e.g., only load planning docs for high-level overview, or specific technical notes for debugging).

## Conclusion

The updated custom mode configuration (v3) provides a more robust, scalable, and secure framework for the multi-agent system compared to v2. The standardized, granular journaling approach, coupled with the refined `secretary` role, directly addresses the need for better organization and supports the goal of creating a detailed project history for improved LLM contextualization and project traceability.
