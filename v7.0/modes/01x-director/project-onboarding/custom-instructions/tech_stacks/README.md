# Project Onboarding - Technology Stacks

This directory is intended to hold pre-defined technology stack configurations or templates.

These configurations can be used by the `project-onboarding` mode during the project initialization process to quickly set up projects with specific technology stacks (e.g., MERN, LAMP, Next.js + Tailwind + Supabase).

*This directory is currently a placeholder. Stack configurations will be added in the future.*
