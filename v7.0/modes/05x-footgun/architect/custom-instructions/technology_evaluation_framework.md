# Technology Evaluation Framework

This document provides a framework for evaluating and selecting technologies within the project.

## Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating a new technology (library, framework, service, etc.), consider the following criteria:

1.  **Functional Fit:**
    *   Does it meet the core functional requirements?
    *   How well does it address the specific problem?
2.  **Non-Functional Fit (NFRs):**
    *   **Performance:** Impact on latency, throughput, resource usage?
    *   **Scalability:** How does it scale? Vertical/Horizontal? Limits?
    *   **Reliability/Availability:** Maturity? Known issues? Fault tolerance?
    *   **Security:** Security track record? Common vulnerabilities? Built-in security features? Compliance?
    *   **Maintainability:** Code complexity? Testability? Ease of updates/patches?
    *   **Usability/Developer Experience:** Ease of learning? Quality of documentation? Tooling support?
3.  **Ecosystem & Community:**
    *   Community size and activity? (Stack Overflow, GitHub, forums)
    *   Availability of skilled developers?
    *   Long-term support and maintenance outlook?
    *   Compatibility with existing stack?
4.  **Cost:**
    *   Licensing fees?
    *   Operational costs (infrastructure, monitoring)?
    *   Development/Integration costs?
    *   Training costs?
5.  **Strategic Alignment:**
    *   Does it align with the project's long-term goals?
    *   Does it introduce unnecessary complexity or dependencies?
    *   Are there preferred/standard technologies already in use?

## Evaluation Process

1.  **Identify Candidates:** List potential technologies that could solve the problem.
2.  **Initial Screening:** Quickly filter out candidates that clearly don't meet critical requirements.
3.  **Detailed Evaluation:** Assess the remaining candidates against the criteria above. Use research, PoCs (Proof of Concepts), or benchmarking if necessary.
4.  **Comparison & Trade-offs:** Compare the evaluated candidates, highlighting the pros and cons of each. Document trade-offs explicitly (see `trade_off_analysis_template.md`).
5.  **Recommendation & Justification:** Make a recommendation based on the evaluation and justify the choice.
6.  **Decision Record:** Document the final decision in an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in the `.decisions/` folder.
