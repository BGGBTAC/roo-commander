# Custom Instructions for Context Condenser Mode

This folder contains context documents specifically tailored for the `context-condenser` mode. This mode generates structured summaries (Condensed Context Indices) from technical documentation.

## Proposed Context Documents:

*   `api-index-template.md`: Template structure for summarizing API documentation.
*   `framework-index-template.md`: Template structure for summarizing framework documentation.
*   `example-condensed-index.md`: An example of a well-structured output index.
*   `sop_condensing.md`: Reference copy of the Standard Operating Procedure for generating indices.

*(These files should be created based on project needs and standards.)*
