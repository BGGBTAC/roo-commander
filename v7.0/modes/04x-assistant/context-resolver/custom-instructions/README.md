# Custom Instructions for Context Resolver Mode

This folder contains context documents specifically tailored for the `context-resolver` mode. This mode reads project artifacts and synthesizes concise summaries.

## Proposed Context Documents:

*   `summary_templates.md`: Standard formats for different summary types (task status, decision, mode capabilities).
*   `source_prioritization.md`: Guidelines on which document types/locations to prioritize for different queries.
*   `information_extraction_tips.md`: Tips for efficiently extracting key information from MDTM tasks, ADRs, etc.

*(These files should be created based on project needs and standards.)*
