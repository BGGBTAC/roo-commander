# Custom Instructions for Session Summarizer Mode

This folder contains context documents specifically tailored for the `session-summarizer` mode. This mode reads project artifacts and generates structured handover summaries.

## Proposed Context Documents:

*   `handover_summary_template.md`: The template defining the structure of the handover summary.
*   `information_extraction_tips.md`: Tips for extracting goals, actions, blockers, etc., from coordination logs and planning documents.

*(These files should be created based on project needs and standards.)*
