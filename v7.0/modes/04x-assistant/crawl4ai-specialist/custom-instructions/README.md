# Custom Instructions for Crawl4AI Specialist Mode

This folder contains context documents specifically tailored for the `crawl4ai-specialist` mode. This mode implements web crawling solutions using the `crawl4ai` Python library.

## Proposed Context Documents:

*   `crawl4ai-docs.md`: Condensed summary/key points of `crawl4ai` documentation.
*   `asyncio-concepts.md`: Basic concepts of Python `asyncio`.
*   `crawling-best-practices.md`: Guidelines for ethical and efficient web crawling.
*   `browser-automation.md`: Concepts related to headless browser control.
*   `html-css-selectors.md`: Reference for CSS selectors for content extraction.

*(These files should be created based on project needs and standards, potentially using `context-condenser` on the official `crawl4ai` documentation.)*
