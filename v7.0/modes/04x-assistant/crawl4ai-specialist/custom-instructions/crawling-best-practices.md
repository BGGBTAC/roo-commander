# Web Crawling Best Practices

Follow these guidelines when implementing web crawlers using `crawl4ai` to ensure ethical and efficient operation.

## 1. Identify Yourself

*   **Set a Descriptive User-Agent:** Use `CrawlerOptions(user_agent=...)` to identify your bot clearly. Include contact information (email or URL) if possible.
    *   *Example:* `"MyProjectBot/1.0 (+http://example.com/bot-info)"`
*   **Avoid Generic User-Agents:** Don't mimic popular browsers unless absolutely necessary and you understand the implications.

## 2. Respect `robots.txt`

*   **Check `robots.txt`:** Understand the rules specified by the website owner regarding which paths are allowed or disallowed for crawlers.
*   **Adhere to Rules:** Configure your crawler (e.g., using filters or boundary options) to respect these rules. *(Note: Confirm if `crawl4ai` has built-in `robots.txt` handling and its behavior).*

## 3. Control Crawl Rate

*   **Implement Delays:** Use `CrawlerOptions(delay=...)` to introduce a pause between requests (e.g., `delay=1` for 1 second). Start with conservative delays.
*   **Limit Concurrency:** Use `CrawlerOptions(concurrency=...)` to limit the number of simultaneous requests to the same server. Start with a low number (e.g., `concurrency=2`).
*   **Monitor Server Load:** If possible, monitor the target server's response times or error rates. Back off if your crawler appears to be causing issues.
*   **Crawl During Off-Peak Hours:** If feasible, schedule crawls during times when the target website typically experiences lower traffic.

## 4. Be Efficient

*   **Filter Aggressively:** Use `Filters(url_filters=..., content_filters=...)` to only request and process pages relevant to your task. Avoid crawling unnecessary sections of a site.
*   **Use Depth Limits:** Set a reasonable `CrawlerOptions(depth=...)` to prevent infinitely deep crawls.
*   **Handle Redirects Sensibly:** Configure how redirects are followed. Avoid infinite redirect loops.
*   **Caching:** Consider implementing caching mechanisms (if not built into `crawl4ai`) to avoid re-fetching unchanged content.

## 5. Handle Errors Gracefully

*   **Implement Retries (Carefully):** Retry failed requests (e.g., due to temporary network issues or server errors like 503) with exponential backoff, but don't retry indefinitely.
*   **Log Errors:** Record network errors, HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx), and parsing errors for later analysis.
*   **Don't Hammer on Errors:** If a specific URL consistently returns errors, stop trying to fetch it after a few attempts.

## 6. Data Handling

*   **Store Data Responsibly:** If storing crawled data, comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Attribute Sources:** Keep track of the source URL for all extracted data.

*(Adherence to these practices is crucial for responsible web crawling.)*
