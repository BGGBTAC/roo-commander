# Source Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess the credibility and relevance of information sources during research.

## Criteria

1.  **Authority:**
    *   Who is the author or publisher? Are they experts in the field?
    *   Is it official documentation (e.g., from the technology creator)?
    *   Is it a reputable organization, academic institution, or well-known technical blogger?
    *   *Priority:* Official docs > Reputable experts/orgs > Known bloggers > Forums/Aggregators > Anonymous sources.
2.  **Accuracy:**
    *   Can the information be verified against other authoritative sources?
    *   Are claims supported by evidence, code examples, or data?
    *   Are there obvious errors or contradictions?
3.  **Objectivity / Bias:**
    *   Does the source present a balanced view, or does it heavily favor a particular product or viewpoint?
    *   Is it sponsored content or marketing material?
    *   Does the author have a clear conflict of interest?
4.  **Currency / Timeliness:**
    *   When was the information published or last updated?
    *   Is it relevant to the current version of the technology being researched?
    *   *Caution:* Older information, especially for rapidly evolving technologies, may be outdated or incorrect.
5.  **Relevance:**
    *   Does the information directly address the research questions?
    *   Is it at the appropriate technical depth?
6.  **Coverage / Completeness:**
    *   Does the source cover the topic comprehensively, or only a narrow aspect?
    *   Are there significant gaps in the information presented?

## Application

*   Apply these criteria when selecting sources to read and when synthesizing findings.
*   Prioritize information from sources scoring higher on authority, accuracy, objectivity, and currency.
*   Acknowledge limitations or potential biases of sources in the research log and potentially in the final summary if significant.
*   If multiple sources conflict, attempt to find a more authoritative source to resolve the discrepancy or note the contradiction in the findings.
