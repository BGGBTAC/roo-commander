# Information Synthesis Techniques

Techniques for analyzing gathered information and creating concise, structured summaries.

## 1. Thematic Analysis

*   **Process:** Read through all gathered notes and findings (from the task log). Identify recurring ideas, concepts, or topics. Group related pieces of information together under common themes.
*   **Output:** A set of key themes that address the core research questions.
*   **Use Case:** Good for open-ended research questions or when exploring a broad topic.

## 2. Question-Driven Synthesis

*   **Process:** Organize findings directly under the specific research questions defined in the planning phase. For each question, consolidate the relevant information gathered from various sources.
*   **Output:** Direct answers to the initial questions, supported by evidence from sources.
*   **Use Case:** Effective when the research task involves answering a specific set of predefined questions.

## 3. Comparative Analysis

*   **Process:** When comparing multiple options (e.g., different libraries, approaches), create a table or structured list comparing them against defined criteria (see `source-evaluation-criteria.md` or task-specific criteria). Highlight pros, cons, and key differences.
*   **Output:** A clear comparison matrix or summary of trade-offs.
*   **Use Case:** Useful for technology selection, approach comparison, or evaluating alternatives.

## 4. Chronological Synthesis

*   **Process:** Organize findings based on a timeline or sequence of events.
*   **Output:** A narrative or timeline describing the evolution of a topic, process, or history.
*   **Use Case:** Relevant when researching the history of a technology, the steps in a process, or analyzing event logs.

## General Synthesis Tips

*   **Identify Key Points:** For each source or theme, extract the most critical pieces of information. What is the main message or finding?
*   **Look for Consensus & Contradictions:** Note where different sources agree or disagree. Highlight contradictions and try to resolve them by consulting more authoritative sources if possible.
*   **Use Structure:** Employ Markdown headings, bullet points, numbered lists, and `code` formatting to organize the information logically.
*   **Be Concise:** Use clear and direct language. Avoid jargon where possible or explain it briefly. Eliminate redundancy. Summarize, don't just copy-paste large blocks of text (unless providing a specific, illustrative quote).
*   **Cite Everything:** Ensure every synthesized point can be traced back to its original source(s) listed in the references.
*   **Executive Summary:** Start the final report with a brief (1-3 sentence) executive summary that captures the most important findings or answers.
