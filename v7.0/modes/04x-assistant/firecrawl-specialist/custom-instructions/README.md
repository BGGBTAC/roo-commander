# Custom Instructions for Firecrawl Specialist Mode

This folder contains context documents specifically tailored for the `firecrawl-specialist` mode. This mode uses the Firecrawl API for web crawling and scraping.

## Proposed Context Documents:

*   `firecrawl-api-reference.md`: Condensed summary of Firecrawl API endpoints, parameters, and responses.
*   `curl-examples.md`: Examples of using `curl` via `execute_command` for Firecrawl API calls.
*   `extraction-options.md`: Details on Firecrawl extraction modes (`markdown`, `llm-extraction`) and schema definition.
*   `api-key-handling.md`: Best practices for securely handling the Firecrawl API key.

*(These files should be created based on project needs and standards, potentially using `context-condenser` on the official Firecrawl documentation.)*
