# AWS Best Practices: Well-Architected Framework Summary

This document summarizes the key principles of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which provides guidance for building secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for applications and workloads.

## 1. Operational Excellence Pillar

Focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improving supporting processes and procedures.

*   **Perform operations as code:** Define infrastructure (IaC), application configuration, and operational procedures as code. Version control, test, and automate changes.
*   **Annotate documentation:** Automate the creation of annotations from application code and infrastructure for documentation.
*   **Make frequent, small, reversible changes:** Design infrastructure and workloads to allow small, incremental changes that can be easily reversed if they fail.
*   **Refine operations procedures frequently:** Regularly review and update operational procedures (e.g., runbooks, playbooks). Use game days to test procedures.
*   **Anticipate failure:** Perform pre-mortems to identify potential failure points. Implement tests (e.g., chaos engineering) to understand failure modes. Design for resilience.
*   **Learn from all operational failures:** Drive improvement by investigating failures and identifying root causes. Share lessons learned.

## 2. Security Pillar

Focuses on protecting information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

*   **Implement a strong identity foundation:** Use the principle of least privilege. Centralize identity management. Enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with AWS resources.
*   **Enable traceability:** Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action.
*   **Apply security at all layers:** Apply a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security controls (e.g., edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, instance, application).
*   **Automate security best practices:** Use automated, code-based security mechanisms to improve speed and accuracy (e.g., automated vulnerability scanning, infrastructure security checks).
*   **Protect data in transit and at rest:** Classify data. Implement mechanisms such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.
*   **Keep people away from data:** Use mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data.
*   **Prepare for security events:** Have incident management processes and tools in place. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.

## 3. Reliability Pillar

Focuses on ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle.

*   **Test recovery procedures:** Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before. Test how systems fail and validate recovery procedures.
*   **Automatically recover from failure:** Monitor systems for key performance indicators (KPIs) and configure systems to trigger automated recovery when a threshold is breached.
*   **Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability:** Replace large, monolithic resources with smaller, homogeneous resources. Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to reduce the impact of a single failure.
*   **Stop guessing capacity:** Monitor demand and workload utilization, and automate the addition or removal of resources to maintain the optimal level. Use Auto Scaling.
*   **Manage change in automation:** Use automation to make changes to infrastructure and applications. Manage changes through processes like automated testing and controlled deployments (e.g., blue/green, canary).

## 4. Performance Efficiency Pillar

Focuses on using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and maintaining that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

*   **Democratize advanced technologies:** Consume technologies as a service (e.g., NoSQL databases, media transcoding, machine learning) rather than building and maintaining them yourself.
*   **Go global in minutes:** Deploy systems in multiple AWS Regions to provide lower latency and a better experience for customers at minimal cost.
*   **Use serverless architectures:** Eliminate the need to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. Reduces operational burden and can lower costs.
*   **Experiment more often:** Use automated testing and deployment to allow for fast experimentation with different instance types, storage, or configurations.
*   **Mechanical sympathy:** Understand how cloud services are consumed and align design choices with their intended use patterns (e.g., understand data access patterns when choosing a database).

## 5. Cost Optimization Pillar

Focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs.

*   **Implement Cloud Financial Management:** Dedicate time and resources to build capability in cost management. Establish cost ownership, goals, and controls.
*   **Adopt a consumption model:** Pay only for the computing resources you consume and increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements.
*   **Measure overall efficiency:** Measure the business output of the workload and the costs associated with delivering it. Use this data to understand the gains from increasing output and reducing cost.
*   **Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting:** Let AWS handle tasks like managing data centers, servers, operating systems, and databases, allowing you to focus on your applications.
*   **Analyze and attribute expenditure:** Use tagging and cost allocation tools to identify the cost and usage of workloads, allowing for transparent attribution of IT costs to revenue streams or individual workload owners. Use this information to make decisions about where to invest resources or reduce costs.
