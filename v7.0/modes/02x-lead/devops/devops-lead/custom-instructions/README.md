# DevOps Lead Context

This directory holds context specifically for the `devops-lead` mode. It is intended to contain:

*   **DevOps Guidelines:** Best practices, standards, and processes for the team's DevOps activities.
*   **Preferred Tooling Configurations:** Standard configurations for tools used in the CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, logging, etc.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Strategies:** High-level designs and strategies for building, testing, and deploying applications.
*   **Infrastructure Templates:** (Potentially in subdirectories) Reusable templates for provisioning infrastructure using tools like:
    *   Terraform (`./terraform/`)
    *   AWS CloudFormation (`./cloudformation/`)
    *   Pulumi (`./pulumi/`)
    *   Other IaC tools

This context helps the `devops-lead` mode provide consistent and informed guidance on infrastructure and deployment matters.
