# Threat Models

This directory contains threat models relevant to the project's architecture, features, or components.

## Purpose

*   Store threat modeling documentation (e.g., diagrams, narratives, identified threats, mitigations).
*   Provide templates or methodologies used for threat modeling (e.g., STRIDE, PASTA, DREAD).
*   Document assumptions, trust boundaries, and attack surfaces considered during modeling.
*   Track the status of identified threats and their mitigations.

*(This is a placeholder file. Populate it with specific threat models, templates, and related documentation for the project.)*
