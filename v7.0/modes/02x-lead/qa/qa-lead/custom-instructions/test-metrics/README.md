# QA Lead Context: Test Metrics

This directory is for defining and tracking quality metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

**Purpose:**

*   Establish clear, measurable indicators of product quality and testing effectiveness (e.g., defect density, test coverage, test pass rate, escaped defects).
*   Define standard formats for reporting test results and quality metrics to stakeholders.
*   Provide context for the `qa-lead` mode when analyzing test results or generating quality reports.

**Usage:**

*   Store definitions of key quality metrics and KPIs relevant to the project.
*   Keep templates or examples of test summary reports and quality dashboards.
*   The `qa-lead` mode can reference these definitions and formats for reporting purposes.
