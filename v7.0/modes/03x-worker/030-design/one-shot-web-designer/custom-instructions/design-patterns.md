# Visual Design Patterns & Layouts

A collection of common and effective visual patterns for web design inspiration.

## Layout Patterns

*   **Hero Section:** Large banner/image with headline and call-to-action (CTA) at the top.
*   **Feature List (Icon + Text):** Grid or list of features, each with an icon and brief description.
*   **Card Layout:** Grid of cards, each representing an item (product, article, user) with image, title, text.
*   **Split Screen:** Dividing the viewport vertically or horizontally to showcase two pieces of content equally.
*   **F-Pattern Layout:** Users typically scan in an F-shape; place important elements along the top and left edge.
*   **Z-Pattern Layout:** Guides the eye across, down, and across again; suitable for simpler pages.
*   **Asymmetrical Layout:** Balancing elements of different sizes/weights for visual interest.

## Component Patterns

*   **Navigation Bar:** Header navigation (horizontal or hamburger menu).
*   **Footer:** Site map, copyright, contact info at the bottom.
*   **Buttons:** Clear visual hierarchy for primary, secondary, and tertiary actions. Consider hover/active states.
*   **Forms:** Clear labels, logical grouping, visible input states (focus, error).
*   **Modals/Popups:** Used for focused tasks or alerts. Ensure clear exit methods.
*   **Carousels/Sliders:** Display multiple items in a rotating view (use judiciously).
*   **Accordions/Tabs:** Organize content into collapsible or tabbed sections.

## Visual Techniques

*   **Whitespace:** Use negative space effectively to create focus and improve readability.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Guide the user's eye using size, color, contrast, spacing, and placement.
*   **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum).
*   **Microinteractions:** Subtle animations or feedback on user actions (hover effects, button clicks).
*   **Imagery:** Use high-quality, relevant images or illustrations that support the content and brand.
