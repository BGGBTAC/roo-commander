# UI/UX Design Patterns & Best Practices

A collection of common patterns focusing on usability, user experience, and interface design principles.

## Interaction Patterns

*   **Wizard:** Guides users through a multi-step process sequentially.
*   **Form Input:** Clear labels, appropriate input types (text, email, password, number, date), validation feedback (inline and on submit), grouping related fields.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   **Top Navigation:** Standard for main site sections.
    *   **Side Navigation:** Useful for applications with many sections or tools.
    *   **Tabs:** Switching between related views within the same context.
    *   **Breadcrumbs:** Showing user's location within a site hierarchy.
*   **Search & Filtering:** Providing intuitive ways to find specific content (search bar, faceted filters, sorting options).
*   **Data Display:**
    *   **Tables:** For structured, comparable data. Consider sorting, pagination, filtering.
    *   **Lists:** For simpler collections of items.
    *   **Cards:** For visually distinct items with mixed content (image, text).
*   **Feedback & Status:**
    *   **Loading Indicators:** Spinners, progress bars for operations taking time.
    *   **Notifications/Toasts:** Brief messages for success, warnings, or errors.
    *   **Validation Messages:** Clear, specific feedback on form errors.

## UX Principles (Nielsen Norman Group Heuristics - Simplified)

1.  **Visibility of System Status:** Keep users informed about what's going on.
2.  **Match Between System & Real World:** Speak the users' language. Follow real-world conventions.
3.  **User Control & Freedom:** Offer easy "undo" and "exit" options.
4.  **Consistency & Standards:** Follow platform and industry conventions. Don't make users guess.
5.  **Error Prevention:** Design interfaces to prevent errors from occurring in the first place.
6.  **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** Make objects, actions, and options visible. Minimize user memory load.
7.  **Flexibility & Efficiency of Use:** Allow users to tailor frequent actions (accelerators, shortcuts).
8.  **Aesthetic & Minimalist Design:** Avoid irrelevant or rarely needed information. Focus on essentials.
9.  **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover from Errors:** Error messages should be clear, explain the problem, and suggest a solution.
10. **Help & Documentation:** Provide easy-to-search help documentation if needed.

## Visual Design Principles

*   Refer to `typography-guide.md` and `color-palettes.md` (if available in project context or this mode's context).
*   **Hierarchy:** Use size, weight, color, spacing to guide the eye.
*   **Alignment:** Align elements consistently for a clean look.
*   **Proximity:** Group related items together visually.
*   **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast for readability and emphasis.
*   **Repetition:** Repeat visual elements (colors, fonts, spacing) for consistency.
