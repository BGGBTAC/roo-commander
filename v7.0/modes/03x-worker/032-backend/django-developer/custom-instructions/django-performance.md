# Django: Performance Optimization

Techniques for improving the performance and scalability of Django applications.

## Core Concept: Reducing Response Time & Resource Usage

Performance optimization aims to make your Django application respond faster to user requests and handle more concurrent users efficiently by reducing database load, minimizing computation, and leveraging caching.

**Key Areas:**

1.  **Database Query Optimization:** Inefficient database queries are a very common bottleneck.
2.  **Caching:** Storing the results of expensive operations (database queries, template fragments, computed values) to avoid re-computation.
3.  **Template Rendering:** Complex template logic or excessive context data can slow down rendering.
4.  **View Logic:** Inefficient algorithms or blocking operations in views.
5.  **Static Assets:** Serving static files (CSS, JS, images) efficiently.
6.  **Middleware:** Excessive or inefficient middleware can add overhead to every request.

## Common Optimization Techniques

1.  **Database Query Optimization (ORM):**
    *   **`select_related()`:** For `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` relationships. Performs an SQL `JOIN` to fetch related objects in the *same* database query, avoiding separate queries when accessing related objects later. Use for single related objects.
        ```python
        # Bad: Hits DB for author on each iteration
        articles = Article.objects.filter(status='published')
        for article in articles:
            print(article.author.user.username) # DB hit per article

        # Good: Fetches author and user in the initial query
        articles = Article.objects.select_related('author__user').filter(status='published')
        for article in articles:
            print(article.author.user.username) # No extra DB hits
        ```
    *   **`prefetch_related()`:** For `ManyToManyField` and reverse `ForeignKey`/`OneToOneField` relationships. Performs a *separate* lookup for the related objects and joins them in Python. Avoids N+1 queries for many-to-many or one-to-many access.
        ```python
        # Bad: Hits DB for categories on each iteration
        articles = Article.objects.filter(status='published')
        for article in articles:
            print([category.name for category in article.categories.all()]) # DB hit per article

        # Good: Fetches all needed categories in a second query
        articles = Article.objects.filter(status='published').prefetch_related('categories')
        for article in articles:
            print([category.name for category in article.categories.all()]) # No extra DB hits
        ```
    *   **`values()` & `values_list()`:** Retrieve only specific columns as dictionaries or tuples, respectively, instead of full model instances. Useful when you only need a few fields.
    *   **`defer()` & `only()`:** Control which model fields are loaded initially. `defer()` loads all *except* specified fields; `only()` loads *only* specified fields. Deferred fields are loaded on first access.
    *   **`count()` & `exists()`:** Use these optimized methods instead of `len(queryset)` or `if queryset:` when you only need the count or to check for existence.
    *   **`update()` & `delete()` (Bulk):** Perform bulk updates/deletes directly in the database instead of iterating through objects and calling `save()`/`delete()` on each.
    *   **Database Indexing:** Add indexes (`db_index=True` on fields or `Meta.indexes`) to columns frequently used in `filter()`, `exclude()`, `order_by()`. Analyze query plans (e.g., using `EXPLAIN`). Coordinate with `database-specialist`.
    *   **`iterator()`:** For processing very large querysets without loading everything into memory at once.

2.  **Caching:**
    *   **Setup:** Configure cache backends (memory, database, Memcached, Redis) in `settings.py` (`CACHES`).
    *   **Low-Level Cache API:** `django.core.cache.cache` provides `get()`, `set()`, `delete()`, etc., for fine-grained caching of query results, computed values, etc.
        ```python
        from django.core.cache import cache

        def get_expensive_data(user_id):
            cache_key = f'expensive_data_{user_id}'
            data = cache.get(cache_key)
            if data is None:
                data = # ... perform expensive operation ...
                cache.set(cache_key, data, timeout=3600) # Cache for 1 hour
            return data
        ```
    *   **Template Fragment Caching:** Cache parts of a template using `{% load cache %}` and `{% cache timeout fragment_name [vary_on_param...] %}` ... `{% endcache %}`. Useful for static sidebars, footers, etc. Vary on parameters like user or language if needed.
    *   **View Caching:** Use decorators (`@cache_page(timeout)`) or middleware (`UpdateCacheMiddleware`, `FetchFromCacheMiddleware`) to cache entire view responses. Be careful with user-specific content.

3.  **Template Optimization:**
    *   Keep template logic simple. Move complex processing to views or custom template tags/filters.
    *   Use `{% cache %}` tag for expensive fragments.
    *   Use `{% with %}` tag to avoid redundant lookups or computations within the template.

4.  **Static Files:**
    *   Use `django.contrib.staticfiles` to manage static files (CSS, JS, images).
    *   Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to gather all static files into `STATIC_ROOT`.
    *   Configure your web server (Nginx, Apache) or a CDN to serve files directly from `STATIC_ROOT` in production for better performance than routing through Django.
    *   Use file compression (Gzip/Brotli) and caching headers for static assets.

5.  **Asynchronous Tasks (Celery):** Offload long-running or resource-intensive tasks (sending emails, generating reports, image processing) to a background task queue like Celery instead of blocking the request-response cycle.

## Profiling & Monitoring

*   **Django Debug Toolbar:** Essential development tool. Shows database queries executed per request (including duplicates and times), cache usage, settings, headers, etc. Helps identify N+1 query problems.
*   **Database Query Plans:** Use `EXPLAIN` (or database-specific tools) to analyze how the database executes complex queries.
*   **Python Profilers:** Use `cProfile` or other profilers to identify bottlenecks in Python code within views or other logic.
*   **Load Testing:** Use tools like Locust or k6 to simulate user load and measure response times/error rates. (Coordinate with `performance-optimizer`).
*   **Monitoring Tools:** Use application performance monitoring (APM) tools (Datadog, New Relic, Sentry) in production to track performance metrics and errors.

Start by optimizing database queries using `select_related`/`prefetch_related` and analyzing queries with Django Debug Toolbar. Implement caching strategically for expensive operations and template fragments. Offload heavy tasks to background workers.
