# Django: Admin Interface

Utilizing and customizing Django's automatic administration interface.

## Core Concept

Django provides a powerful, built-in administration interface (`django.contrib.admin`) that reads metadata from your models to offer a quick, model-centric interface for site administrators to create, read, update, and delete content.

## Enabling the Admin

1.  **Ensure `django.contrib.admin` is in `INSTALLED_APPS`:** (It's included by default in new projects).
    ```python
    # settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'myapp', # Your app(s)
        # ...
    ]
    ```
2.  **Include Admin URLs:** Add the admin URLs to your root `urls.py`.
    ```python
    # project/urls.py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls), # Default admin path
        # ... other paths ...
    ]
    ```
3.  **Run Migrations:** Ensure database tables for admin and related apps (auth, contenttypes, sessions) are created: `python manage.py migrate`.
4.  **Create Superuser:** Create an initial admin user: `python manage.py createsuperuser`. Follow the prompts.
5.  **Run Server:** Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.
6.  **Access:** Navigate to `/admin/` in your browser and log in with the superuser credentials.

## Registering Models (`admin.py`)

*   To make your app's models appear in the admin interface, you need to register them in the app's `admin.py` file.

```python
# myapp/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Author, Category, Post # Import your models

# Simple registration (uses default admin options)
admin.site.register(Author)
admin.site.register(Category)
admin.site.register(Post)
```

## Customizing the Admin (`ModelAdmin`)

*   To customize how models are displayed and managed in the admin, create a `ModelAdmin` subclass and register the model with it.

```python
# myapp/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Author, Category, Post

# Simple registration remains the same for Author and Category
admin.site.register(Author)
admin.site.register(Category)

# Custom Admin class for Post model
@admin.register(Post) # Use decorator for registration (alternative to admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin))
class PostAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    # Display these fields in the change list view
    list_display = ('title', 'slug', 'author', 'publish_date', 'status')
    # Add filters in the sidebar
    list_filter = ('status', 'publish_date', 'author')
    # Add search functionality based on these fields
    search_fields = ('title', 'content')
    # Automatically populate slug field based on title (in add form)
    prepopulated_fields = {'slug': ('title',)}
    # Use raw ID fields for ForeignKey lookups (better performance for many related objects)
    raw_id_fields = ('author',)
    # Customize ordering in the change list
    ordering = ('status', '-publish_date')
    # Customize the edit form layout
    fieldsets = (
        (None, {
            'fields': ('title', 'slug', 'author', 'status')
        }),
        ('Content', {
            'fields': ('content',)
        }),
        ('Metadata', {
            'fields': ('categories',),
            'classes': ('collapse',) # Make this section collapsible
        }),
    )
    # Add horizontal filter for ManyToManyFields
    filter_horizontal = ('categories',)
    # Add date hierarchy navigation
    date_hierarchy = 'publish_date'

# Note: You can also register without the decorator:
# admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin)
```

## Common `ModelAdmin` Options

*   `list_display`: Tuple/list of field names to show as columns on the change list page. Can include model methods.
*   `list_filter`: Tuple/list of field names to create filters by in the sidebar. Works well with `DateField`, `BooleanField`, `ForeignKey`.
*   `search_fields`: Tuple/list of field names to enable searching on. Uses `LIKE` queries (`CharField`, `TextField`).
*   `prepopulated_fields`: Dictionary mapping a field name (usually `SlugField`) to a tuple/list of fields to populate it from dynamically in JavaScript.
*   `raw_id_fields`: Tuple/list of `ForeignKey` or `ManyToManyField` names to display as a simple input box with a lookup popup, instead of a dropdown (improves performance for many related objects).
*   `date_hierarchy`: Name of a `DateField` or `DateTimeField` to enable drill-down navigation by date.
*   `ordering`: Default ordering for the change list.
*   `fieldsets`: Customize the layout of the add/change form, grouping fields into sections.
*   `filter_horizontal`, `filter_vertical`: Use a more user-friendly multi-select interface for `ManyToManyField`s.
*   `inlines`: Allow editing related models (via `ForeignKey`) on the same page as the parent model (e.g., edit `Choice`s while editing a `Question`). Requires defining `admin.TabularInline` or `admin.StackedInline` subclasses.
*   `readonly_fields`: Fields to display as read-only on the change form.
*   `actions`: Add custom bulk actions to the change list dropdown.

## Security

*   The admin site respects Django's permission system. Users only see and interact with models they have permission for.
*   Protect your admin URL (consider changing it from the default `/admin/`).
*   Ensure only trusted staff have admin access.

The Django admin is a powerful tool for managing application data, and `ModelAdmin` provides extensive options for tailoring it to your needs.
