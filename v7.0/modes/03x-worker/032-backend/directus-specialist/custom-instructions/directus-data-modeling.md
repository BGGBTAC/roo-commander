# Directus: Data Modeling Best Practices

Designing effective collections, fields, and relationships in Directus.

## Core Concept: Structuring Your Data

Effective data modeling is crucial for building maintainable and performant applications with Directus. It involves defining collections (tables), fields (columns), and the relationships between them in a way that accurately represents your data and supports your application's use cases.

Directus provides a user-friendly interface (Data Studio) for modeling, which translates your design into standard SQL database schema elements.

## Collections

*   **Purpose:** Represent the main entities or types of content in your application (e.g., `articles`, `products`, `users`, `categories`, `orders`).
*   **Naming:** Use plural nouns, typically `snake_case` (as this often matches SQL table naming conventions, though Directus handles the mapping). Be consistent.
*   **Primary Key:** Directus automatically manages a primary key field (usually `id`, often a UUID by default).
*   **System Collections:** Be aware of `directus_*` collections used internally by Directus. Avoid naming custom collections with this prefix.

## Fields

*   **Purpose:** Represent individual attributes or pieces of data within a collection (e.g., `title`, `publish_date`, `price`, `is_active`).
*   **Naming:** Use consistent naming, often `snake_case`.
*   **Data Type Selection:** Choose the most appropriate underlying SQL data type (String, Integer, Float, Boolean, DateTime, JSON, etc.) based on the kind of data the field will store. This impacts storage, validation, and querying.
*   **Interface Selection:** Choose the best UI interface for content editors in the Data Studio (e.g., Text Input, WYSIWYG, DateTime Picker, Select Dropdown, Relational Interface). The interface doesn't change the underlying data type but improves usability.
*   **Required Fields:** Mark fields as required if they must always have a value.
*   **Validation:** Configure validation rules (e.g., min/max length, format checks like email) directly on the field settings.
*   **Default Values:** Set default values where appropriate.
*   **Indexes:** Add database indexes to fields that are frequently used in API filters (`filter`), sorting (`sort`), or relationships to improve query performance. Coordinate with `database-specialist` for complex indexing strategies.

## Relationships

Choosing the right relationship type is key:

*   **Many-to-One (M2O):**
    *   **Use Case:** An item belongs to *one* parent item (e.g., an `article` has one `author` from the `users` collection).
    *   **Implementation:** Add a field to the "many" collection (`articles`) that links to the "one" collection (`users`). Directus creates a foreign key column.
    *   **Interface:** Typically a Dropdown or Relational selector in the Data Studio.
*   **One-to-Many (O2M):**
    *   **Use Case:** An item can have *many* child items (e.g., a `user` has many `articles`).
    *   **Implementation:** This is the *inverse* of an M2O. You define the M2O field on the "many" side (`articles.author`), and Directus automatically makes the O2M relationship available on the "one" side (`users.articles`).
    *   **Interface:** Typically a Relational list/table interface on the "one" side.
*   **Many-to-Many (M2M):**
    *   **Use Case:** Items in two collections can be linked freely (e.g., `articles` and `tags`). An article can have multiple tags, and a tag can be used on multiple articles.
    *   **Implementation:** Directus creates a hidden "junction" collection (e.g., `articles_tags`) with foreign keys to both related collections. You configure the M2M field on one or both sides.
    *   **Interface:** Typically a Tag selector or Checkbox group interface.
*   **Translations (Special O2M):** Directus has a dedicated "Translations" interface for managing multilingual content, which uses an O2M relationship to a separate translations collection (e.g., `articles_translations`).
*   **Files (Special O2M/M2M):** The "File" / "Image" interface uses relationships to the `directus_files` system collection.

## Best Practices

*   **Plan Ahead:** Think about your data structure and how different pieces relate before creating collections and fields. Consider future needs.
*   **Normalize (Usually):** Avoid excessive data duplication. Use relationships to link related data instead of copying information between collections (similar to database normalization principles).
*   **Denormalize (Sometimes):** For performance-critical read operations, sometimes intentionally duplicating *small*, frequently needed data (like an author's name on an article) can avoid complex joins, but use this cautiously. Caching is often a better first step.
*   **Use Appropriate Types:** Don't store numbers as strings or dates as plain text. Use the correct data types for better validation and querying.
*   **Configure Interfaces:** Choose user-friendly interfaces for content editors.
*   **Set Permissions:** Configure roles and permissions *after* defining your data model to control access correctly.
*   **Consider API Queries:** Think about how data will be filtered, sorted, and queried via the API when designing fields and relationships. Add indexes where needed.

Effective data modeling in Directus involves understanding your data, choosing appropriate field types and interfaces, defining relationships correctly, and considering how the data will be managed and consumed via the API.
