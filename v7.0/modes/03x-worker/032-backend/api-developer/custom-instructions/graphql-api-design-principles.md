# GraphQL API Design Principles & Best Practices

Guidelines for designing effective, maintainable, and performant GraphQL APIs.

## Core GraphQL Concepts

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with existing data. It emphasizes client-specified data requirements.

1.  **Schema Definition Language (SDL):** A human-readable language used to define the API's type system. This schema acts as the contract between the client and server.
    *   **Types:** Define the structure of objects (e.g., `type User { id: ID!, name: String }`).
    *   **Fields:** Properties within types, each with its own type.
    *   **Scalars:** Primitive types (`Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean`, `ID`). Custom scalars can also be defined.
    *   **Query Type:** Defines the entry points for read operations.
    *   **Mutation Type:** Defines the entry points for write operations (create, update, delete).
    *   **Subscription Type:** Defines entry points for real-time, event-based data pushes.
    *   **Input Types:** Define the shape of objects passed as arguments to mutations or queries.
    *   **Enums:** Define a restricted set of possible values for a field.
    *   **Interfaces & Unions:** Allow for polymorphism in the schema.
2.  **Strongly Typed:** Every level of a GraphQL query corresponds to a particular type defined in the schema, and the fields requested must exist on that type.
3.  **Client-Specified Queries:** Clients request *exactly* the data they need, including nested relationships, in a single request. This avoids over-fetching (getting more data than needed) and under-fetching (requiring multiple requests) common in REST.
4.  **Resolvers:** Server-side functions responsible for fetching the data for a specific field in the schema. Each field typically has a corresponding resolver function. Resolvers can fetch data from databases, other APIs, etc.

## Best Practices for Schema Design

1.  **Think in Graphs, Not Endpoints:** Model your data as a graph of interconnected objects (types) rather than a collection of resource endpoints.
2.  **Prioritize Client Use Cases:** Design the schema based on how clients will actually consume the data, not necessarily mirroring your database structure directly.
3.  **Use Descriptive Names:** Choose clear and consistent names for types, fields, arguments, enums, etc. (Often `camelCase` for fields/arguments, `PascalCase` for types/enums).
4.  **Use Non-Null (`!`) Wisely:** Mark fields/arguments as non-null (`!`) only when the server can *guarantee* a value will always be returned or is always required. This provides stronger guarantees to the client. Use nullable types for optional data.
5.  **Use Input Types for Mutations:** Group related arguments for mutations into `input` types for better organization and easier evolution.
    ```graphql
    input CreateUserInput {
      name: String!
      email: String!
      role: UserRole # Enum
    }

    type Mutation {
      createUser(input: CreateUserInput!): User
    }
    ```
6.  **Mutation Response Types:** Design mutation responses to return the data the client will likely need after the mutation (e.g., the updated/created object). Consider a payload structure including the object and potential errors.
    ```graphql
    type CreateUserPayload {
      user: User
      errors: [UserError!]
    }
    type Mutation {
      createUser(input: CreateUserInput!): CreateUserPayload
    }
    ```
7.  **Clear Error Handling:** Define how errors are represented (e.g., a top-level `errors` field alongside `data`, or specific error types within mutation payloads).
8.  **Pagination:** Use standardized pagination patterns (like Relay Cursor Connections or offset/limit) for lists that can grow large. Define `Connection` and `Edge` types.
9.  **Use Enums for Fixed Sets:** Define `enum` types for fields with a limited set of predefined string values (e.g., status, roles).
10. **Use Interfaces/Unions for Polymorphism:** When fields can return different object types that share common fields (interface) or are distinct (union).
11. **Documentation (Descriptions):** Add descriptions to types, fields, and arguments using string literals or block strings (`"""Description"""`) in the SDL. This is crucial for schema introspection and tools like GraphiQL.

## Resolver Best Practices

1.  **Keep Resolvers Thin:** Resolvers should primarily delegate data fetching logic to dedicated service/data access layers (e.g., database models, service classes). Avoid putting complex business logic directly in resolvers.
2.  **Batching & Caching (Data Loaders):** Avoid the "N+1 problem" where resolving fields for a list results in numerous individual database queries. Use data loader patterns (like `dataloader-js`) to batch requests for related data within a single request lifecycle. Implement caching where appropriate.
3.  **Error Handling:** Catch errors in data fetching logic and map them to appropriate GraphQL error responses.
4.  **Authorization:** Implement authorization checks within resolvers or dedicated middleware/directives to ensure the user has permission to access the requested field/data.

## Query/Mutation Design

*   **Queries:** Should be side-effect free (idempotent).
*   **Mutations:** Should represent state-changing operations. Design them to be as specific as possible (e.g., `addUserToGroup` rather than a generic `updateUser`).

GraphQL offers flexibility but requires careful schema design to be effective. Prioritize client needs, use strong typing effectively, and implement efficient resolvers with data loading patterns.
