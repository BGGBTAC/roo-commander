*   `graphql-api-design-principles.md`: SDL, types, queries, mutations, resolvers.
*   `api-security-fundamentals.md`: Validation, AuthN/AuthZ basics, HTTPS, rate limiting, OWASP Top 10.
*   `api-versioning-strategies.md`: URI, query param, header versioning.
*   `api-error-handling.md`: Consistent error formats, status codes.
*   `openapi-swagger-basics.md`: Spec structure, paths, operations, schemas.
*   `api-testing-strategies.md`: Unit, integration, contract testing concepts.
*   `api-performance-caching.md`: HTTP caching headers, basic patterns.
*   `json-data-formats.md`: Standard JSON, common conventions.

*(These files should be created based on project needs and standards, referencing relevant specifications and best practices.)*
