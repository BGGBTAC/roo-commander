# MongoDB: Schema Design Patterns

Common patterns for modeling data in MongoDB's document model.

## Core Concept: Flexibility vs. Performance

MongoDB's flexible schema allows documents in the same collection to have different fields. However, designing your schema effectively is crucial for performance, queryability, and data consistency. The main trade-off is between **embedding** related data within a single document versus **referencing** data across multiple documents/collections.

## Key Patterns

1.  **Embedding (Denormalization):**
    *   **Concept:** Store related data together within a single document, often using nested objects or arrays.
    *   **Example:** Storing address details directly within a `user` document, or storing `comments` as an array within a `post` document.
        ```json
        // User document with embedded address
        {
          "_id": ObjectId("..."),
          "name": "Alice",
          "email": "alice@example.com",
          "address": { // Embedded object
            "street": "123 Main St",
            "city": "Anytown",
            "zip": "12345"
          }
        }

        // Post document with embedded comments array
        {
          "_id": ObjectId("..."),
          "title": "My Blog Post",
          "content": "...",
          "comments": [ // Embedded array
            { "user": "Bob", "text": "Great post!", "timestamp": ISODate("...") },
            { "user": "Charlie", "text": "I agree.", "timestamp": ISODate("...") }
          ]
        }
        ```
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Faster Reads:** Retrieve all related data in a single query (atomic read). Reduces need for multiple queries or `$lookup`.
        *   **Atomicity:** Updates to a single document are atomic.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   **Larger Documents:** Can lead to large documents, potentially hitting the 16MB BSON document size limit.
        *   **Update Complexity:** Updating deeply nested data can be more complex.
        *   **Data Duplication:** If the embedded data is also stored elsewhere or frequently changes, embedding leads to duplication and potential inconsistencies if not updated everywhere.
    *   **When to Use:**
        *   "Contains" relationships (one-to-few).
        *   Data that is frequently accessed together.
        *   Data that doesn't change often independently.
        *   When atomicity for related data is crucial.
        *   When read performance is paramount.

2.  **Referencing (Normalization):**
    *   **Concept:** Store related data in separate collections and use references (typically the `_id` of the related document) to link them. Similar to relational database foreign keys.
    *   **Example:** Storing `user_id` in a `post` document to link to the `users` collection.
        ```json
        // users collection
        { "_id": ObjectId("user1"), "name": "Alice" }

        // posts collection
        {
          "_id": ObjectId("post1"),
          "title": "My Blog Post",
          "content": "...",
          "user_id": ObjectId("user1") // Reference to user document
        }
        ```
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Smaller Documents:** Keeps individual documents smaller.
        *   **Easier Updates:** Updating related data only requires changing it in one place. Avoids data duplication.
        *   **Flexibility:** Handles complex relationships (many-to-many, large one-to-many) more easily.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   **Slower Reads (Potentially):** Retrieving related data requires multiple queries or using the `$lookup` aggregation stage, which can be less performant than reading a single embedded document.
        *   **No Automatic Joins:** Requires application-level joins or `$lookup`.
    *   **When to Use:**
        *   "Belongs to" relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).
        *   When related data changes frequently or is large.
        *   To avoid exceeding the 16MB document size limit.
        *   When data consistency across references is important.

3.  **Two-Way Referencing:**
    *   **Concept:** Store references on both sides of the relationship (e.g., `user` document has an array of `post_ids`, and `post` document has a `user_id`).
    *   **Pros:** Allows querying the relationship from either side without `$lookup`.
    *   **Cons:** Increased complexity to maintain consistency across both references during updates/deletes. Requires careful handling (e.g., using transactions or multi-document updates).

4.  **Denormalization (Subset Embedding):**
    *   **Concept:** Embed a *subset* of frequently needed data from a related document to optimize common read operations, while still maintaining a reference for the full related document.
    *   **Example:** Embedding `user.name` and `user._id` in comments, but referencing the full user document elsewhere.
        ```json
        // Post document with comments having subset of user data
        {
          "_id": ObjectId("..."),
          "title": "My Blog Post",
          "comments": [
            {
              "user": { "_id": ObjectId("user1"), "name": "Alice" }, // Embedded subset
              "text": "Great post!",
              "timestamp": ISODate("...")
            },
            // ...
          ]
        }
        ```
    *   **Pros:** Improves read performance for common cases by avoiding `$lookup`, while still allowing access to the full related document via the reference if needed.
    *   **Cons:** Introduces some data duplication. Requires updating the embedded subset if the source data changes (can use Change Streams or application logic).

## Choosing the Right Pattern

The best approach depends heavily on your application's specific data access patterns:

*   **Read Frequency vs. Write Frequency:** If data is read together much more often than it's updated independently, embedding is often better. If related data is updated frequently, referencing might be preferred.
*   **Data Cardinality:** One-to-few relationships often favor embedding. One-to-many or many-to-many often favor referencing, especially if the "many" side can grow large.
*   **Data Size:** Avoid embedding large amounts of data or arrays that can grow unboundedly to prevent hitting the 16MB limit.
*   **Atomicity Needs:** If updates to related data must be atomic, embedding within a single document is the simplest way. Transactions can handle atomicity across documents but add complexity.
*   **Consistency:** Referencing ensures data consistency as it's stored in one place. Embedding requires managing potential inconsistencies if duplicated data isn't updated correctly.

Analyze your application's queries and update patterns to make informed decisions about embedding versus referencing. It's common to use a mix of patterns within the same application.
