*   `query-dsl-examples.md`: Common query patterns (`match`, `bool`, `terms`, `nested`, etc.).
*   `mapping-templates.md`: Reusable mapping templates (`text`, `keyword`, `date`, `dense_vector`).
*   `vector-search-examples.md`: Implementing vector search (`dense_vector`, k-NN).
*   `performance-tuning.md`: Best practices for optimization (query structure, mapping, caching).
*   `cluster-management.md`: Common cluster commands (`_cat` APIs, health, snapshots).
*   `analyzers-reference.md`: Reference for built-in and custom analyzers.
*   `aggregations-examples.md`: Common aggregation patterns (`terms`, `date_histogram`, `top_hits`).
*   `esql-reference.md`: Basic ESQL syntax and common commands.
