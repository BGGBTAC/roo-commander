# Elasticsearch: Key Version Differences (e.g., 7.x vs 8.x)

Highlighting significant changes between major Elasticsearch versions relevant to development.

## Core Concept

Elasticsearch evolves, introducing new features, changing APIs, and sometimes removing old functionality. Being aware of the target version is crucial for writing compatible queries, mappings, and using appropriate features.

## Key Differences (Focus on 7.x vs 8.x)

*(Note: This is a high-level summary. Always consult the official migration guides for the specific versions involved for comprehensive details.)*

**1. Mapping & Index Templates:**

*   **Removal of Mapping Types (8.x):** Elasticsearch 7.x deprecated mapping types, and 8.x removed them entirely. Indices now have a single, implicit type (`_doc`). APIs that previously required a type (e.g., `PUT /my-index/my_type/1`) now omit the type (`PUT /my-index/_doc/1` or often just `PUT /my-index/_create/1`, `POST /my-index/_doc`). Index templates also reflect this change.
*   **Index Templates (Composable vs Legacy):** 8.x strongly favors **Composable Index Templates**. Legacy templates (`_template`) are still supported but deprecated. Composable templates use `index_patterns`, `template` (containing `settings`, `mappings`, `aliases`), `priority`, `component_templates`, and `_meta`.

**2. Query DSL & APIs:**

*   **API Compatibility Headers:** 8.x clients often need to send specific `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers (e.g., `application/json`) for strict content type checking.
*   **Default Search Operator:** The default operator for `match` queries might have subtle changes; review documentation if migrating complex queries.
*   **New Query Types/Features (8.x):** Introduction or enhancement of features like k-NN search, ESQL, improved relevance tuning options.
*   **Deprecated/Removed APIs:** Some older APIs or specific query syntaxes might be removed in 8.x. Check deprecation logs and migration guides.

**3. Security:**

*   **Enabled by Default (8.x):** Security features (authentication, TLS) are enabled by default in 8.x distributions. This requires setting up passwords, certificates, and potentially tokens during initial cluster setup, which wasn't the default in earlier versions.
*   **API Keys:** Increased emphasis on using API keys for authentication over basic auth for programmatic access.

**4. Cluster Coordination & Internals:**

*   **Master -> Master-eligible Node:** Terminology change.
*   **Coordination Layer:** Significant internal changes in how clusters are managed, generally improving resilience but potentially affecting upgrade paths.

**5. Vector Search (`dense_vector`):**

*   While introduced earlier, vector search capabilities (k-NN search, `dense_vector` field type, similarity options) have seen significant development and refinement in later 7.x versions and especially in 8.x. Indexing options (`hnsw`, `int8_flat`) and query syntax might differ.

**6. ESQL (Elasticsearch Query Language):**

*   A newer, pipe-based query language introduced to provide a SQL-like interface for data exploration and aggregation. More prominent in 8.x.

## Migration Considerations

*   **Reindex:** Migrating between major versions (especially 7.x to 8.x) often requires reindexing data from the old cluster to a new one, particularly due to the removal of mapping types. Elasticsearch provides tools like `_reindex` API and Logstash to facilitate this.
*   **Upgrade Assistant:** Kibana includes an Upgrade Assistant to help identify potential issues and guide the upgrade process.
*   **Client Compatibility:** Ensure your Elasticsearch client library version is compatible with the target cluster version.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Always test applications extensively against the new version in a non-production environment before upgrading production clusters.

Understanding the version is the first step in ensuring compatibility and leveraging the correct features.
