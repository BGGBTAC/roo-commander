# CSS Best Practices for Maintainability & Responsiveness

Guidelines for writing clean, effective, and maintainable CSS.

## 1. Organization & Structure

*   **Consistent Naming Convention:** Use a clear and consistent naming convention for classes. Common choices include:
    *   **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier):** `.block__element--modifier` (e.g., `.card__title--highlighted`). Promotes modularity and reduces specificity conflicts.
    *   **Utility-First (like Tailwind):** Relies on many small, single-purpose classes (e.g., `.mt-4`, `.text-center`, `.bg-blue-500`). Often used with frameworks.
    *   Choose one and stick to it within the project.
*   **File Structure:** Organize CSS into logical files/modules (e.g., base styles, layout, components, utilities). If using Sass/Less, leverage partials (`_partial.scss`) and import them into a main file.
*   **Comments:** Use comments (`/* ... */`) to explain complex selectors, non-obvious styles, or section purposes.

## 2. Selectors & Specificity

*   **Prefer Classes:** Style primarily using classes. Avoid relying heavily on tag selectors (`div`, `p`) or ID selectors (`#my-id`) which increase specificity and make overrides harder.
*   **Keep Specificity Low:** Avoid overly complex selectors (e.g., `.nav ul li a.active`). Lower specificity makes styles easier to override and manage. BEM helps with this.
*   **Avoid `!important`:** Use `!important` only as a last resort for overriding external styles or very specific utility needs. Overuse makes debugging difficult.
*   **Attribute Selectors:** Use attribute selectors (`[type="text"]`, `[data-state="active"]`) for styling based on attributes.

## 3. Responsiveness (Mobile-First)

*   **Mobile-First Approach:** Write base styles for mobile devices first. Then, use `min-width` media queries to add or override styles for larger screens. This generally leads to simpler CSS.
    ```css
    /* Base mobile styles */
    .container {
      width: 100%;
      padding: 1rem;
    }
    .sidebar {
      display: none; /* Hidden on mobile */
    }

    /* Tablet and up */
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      .container {
        max-width: 720px;
        margin: auto;
      }
      .sidebar {
        display: block; /* Show sidebar */
        width: 250px;
      }
      .main-content {
        margin-left: 250px; /* Adjust layout */
      }
    }

    /* Desktop and up */
    @media (min-width: 992px) {
      .container {
        max-width: 960px;
      }
      /* Add further adjustments */
    }
    ```
*   **Relative Units:** Use relative units like `rem` (relative to root font size) for font sizes and `em` (relative to parent font size) for padding/margins where appropriate, allowing easier scaling. Use `%` for widths where elements should scale with their container. Use `vh`/`vw` for viewport-relative sizing.
*   **Flexbox & Grid:** Use CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout. They provide powerful and flexible ways to create responsive designs.
*   **Fluid Images/Media:** Use `max-width: 100%; height: auto;` for images and videos to prevent them from overflowing their containers.

## 4. Maintainability

*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Group common styles using shared classes or Sass/Less mixins/extends.
*   **CSS Variables (Custom Properties):** Use CSS variables (`--my-color: #ff0000; color: var(--my-color);`) for themeable values (colors, fonts, spacing) to make global changes easier.
*   **Logical Property Order:** Consider ordering properties consistently within a rule (e.g., positioning, box model, typography, visual).
*   **Reset/Normalize:** Use a CSS reset (like `normalize.css` or a simpler custom reset) to reduce browser inconsistencies before applying your styles.

## 5. Performance

*   **Minimize Reflows/Repaints:** Be aware that changing certain properties (like `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`) can trigger expensive browser recalculations. Prefer `transform` and `opacity` for animations where possible.
*   **Selector Efficiency:** While less critical in modern browsers, overly complex selectors *can* impact performance slightly. Keep selectors reasonably simple.
*   **Reduce File Size:** Minify CSS for production. Consider removing unused CSS (requires tooling).
