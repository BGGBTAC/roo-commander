# Custom Instructions for E2E Testing Specialist Mode

This folder contains context documents specifically tailored for the `e2e-tester` mode. This mode focuses on designing, writing, executing, and maintaining End-to-End (E2E) tests using frameworks like Cypress, Playwright, and Selenium.

## Proposed Context Documents:

*   `e2e-best-practices.md`: General principles for stable and maintainable E2E tests.
*   `e2e-selector-strategies.md`: Prioritizing robust selectors (`data-testid`, user-facing attributes).
*   `e2e-framework-cypress.md`: Cypress API quick reference and patterns.
*   `e2e-framework-playwright.md`: Playwright API quick reference and patterns.
*   `e2e-framework-selenium.md`: Selenium WebDriver API quick reference and patterns.
*   `e2e-test-data-management.md`: Strategies for test data creation and cleanup.
*   `e2e-page-object-model.md`: Explanation and examples of POM.
*   `e2e-flaky-tests.md`: Identifying and mitigating flakiness.
*   `e2e-reporting-analysis.md`: Interpreting results, using artifacts (logs, screenshots).

*(These files should be created based on project needs and standards, referencing official documentation for the relevant E2E testing frameworks.)*
