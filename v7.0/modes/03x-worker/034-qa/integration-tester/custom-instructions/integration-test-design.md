# Integration Testing: Test Design & Planning

Strategies for designing effective integration test cases and planning their execution.

## Core Concept: Focusing on Interactions

Integration test design focuses on verifying the communication points *between* components, not the internal logic *within* them. The goal is to ensure that when units are combined, they interact correctly according to their defined interfaces and contracts.

## Steps in Integration Test Design

1.  **Identify Integration Points:**
    *   Analyze architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger), component diagrams, and requirements documents.
    *   Use `read_file` to examine relevant documentation.
    *   Identify where different components, services, modules, or systems interact. Examples:
        *   Frontend calling a backend API.
        *   Backend service calling another backend service (microservices).
        *   Service interacting with a database.
        *   Service interacting with a message queue.
        *   Service calling a third-party API.
        *   Internal modules calling each other's public functions/methods.

2.  **Understand the Contract/Interface:**
    *   For each integration point, clearly define the "contract":
        *   **API Calls:** Expected request format (URL, method, headers, body/payload schema), expected response format (status codes, headers, body schema), authentication requirements.
        *   **Database:** Schema of tables being read/written, expected data formats, constraints.
        *   **Message Queues:** Message format, queue/topic names, expected headers/metadata.
        *   **Function Calls:** Function signature (arguments, types, return value).

3.  **Define Test Scenarios:**
    *   Based on the integration points and contracts, brainstorm scenarios to test the interaction. Cover:
        *   **Happy Path:** The expected, successful interaction flow.
        *   **Error Conditions:** How does the system handle expected errors (e.g., invalid input, resource not found (404), unauthorized access (401/403), server errors (5xx))? Does the calling component react appropriately?
        *   **Boundary Conditions:** Test interactions with edge-case data (e.g., empty lists, zero values, maximum lengths, special characters).
        *   **Data Validation:** Verify how the receiving component validates data sent by the calling component.
        *   **Concurrency (if applicable):** How do components interact under concurrent requests? (May overlap with performance testing).

4.  **Design Specific Test Cases:**
    *   For each scenario, write specific, actionable test cases with clear steps, inputs, and expected outcomes.
    *   **Example (API Integration):**
        *   **Scenario:** User successfully retrieves profile data.
        *   **Test Case:**
            1.  **Setup:** Ensure user 'testuser' exists with specific profile data in the database (or mock the User Service response).
            2.  **Action:** Send a GET request to `/api/v1/users/testuser/profile` with valid authentication.
            3.  **Expected Outcome:** Receive a 200 OK status code.
            4.  **Expected Outcome:** Response body contains JSON matching the profile schema, including user's email and name.
        *   **Scenario:** Requesting profile for non-existent user.
        *   **Test Case:**
            1.  **Setup:** Ensure user 'ghostuser' does not exist.
            2.  **Action:** Send a GET request to `/api/v1/users/ghostuser/profile` with valid authentication.
            3.  **Expected Outcome:** Receive a 404 Not Found status code.
            4.  **Expected Outcome:** Response body contains an appropriate error message.

5.  **Plan Test Data Strategy:**
    *   Determine what data is needed for each test case.
    *   Decide *how* this data will be created (API calls, DB seeding, fixtures, factories) and cleaned up. (See `integration-test-data-strategies.md`).
    *   Ensure data setup is reliable and isolated.

6.  **Identify Need for Test Doubles:**
    *   Determine if any real dependencies need to be replaced with mocks, stubs, or fakes to isolate the interaction under test or to control the dependency's behavior (e.g., simulating network errors from a third-party API). (See `test-doubles.md`).

7.  **Select Tools & Frameworks:**
    *   Choose appropriate tools based on the type of integration (API testing tools like Postman/Newman, testing frameworks like `pytest` with `requests`/`httpx`, contract testing tools like Pact).

8.  **Document the Plan:**
    *   Record the identified integration points, key scenarios, high-level test cases, data strategy, and required test doubles in the task log or a dedicated test plan document.

Effective integration test design requires a good understanding of the system architecture and the contracts between components. Focus on verifying the *interactions* and data flow across boundaries, covering both successful and error scenarios.
