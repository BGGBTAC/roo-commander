# Integration Testing: Test Environments

Considerations for setting up and managing environments suitable for integration testing.

## Core Concept: Realistic Interaction Context

Integration tests verify interactions between components. To be effective, these tests need to run in an environment that allows the components under test to communicate realistically, while providing sufficient isolation and control.

**Challenges:**

*   **Complexity:** Setting up multiple services, databases, message queues, etc., can be complex.
*   **Isolation:** Preventing tests from interfering with each other or with other development/testing activities.
*   **Consistency:** Ensuring the environment is consistent and repeatable for reliable test results.
*   **Cost:** Running dedicated environments, especially in the cloud, can incur costs.
*   **External Dependencies:** Managing interactions with real third-party services (availability, cost, rate limits).

## Common Environment Strategies

1.  **Local Docker Compose:**
    *   **How:** Define all required services (application services, databases, message queues, mocks for external services) in a `docker-compose.yml` file. Run `docker-compose up` to create an isolated, local environment for testing. Tests (running on the host or in another container) interact with services via their exposed ports.
    *   **Pros:** Excellent isolation. Relatively easy setup and teardown. Consistent environment defined in code. Good for developer machines and CI.
    *   **Cons:** Can consume significant local resources (RAM, CPU). Might not perfectly replicate production network conditions or cloud service configurations.
    *   **Tools:** Docker, Docker Compose.

2.  **Dedicated Shared Test Environment:**
    *   **How:** A persistent environment (often cloud-hosted) where integrated services are deployed specifically for testing purposes. Multiple developers or CI jobs might share this environment.
    *   **Pros:** More closely resembles production infrastructure. Can test interactions with managed cloud services (databases, queues).
    *   **Cons:** Risk of interference between concurrent tests or users if not managed carefully (e.g., data conflicts). Setup and maintenance overhead. Potential cost. Slower feedback loop than local setup.
    *   **Mitigation for Interference:** Use unique test data identifiers, namespace resources, or implement resource locking/pooling if sharing is necessary.

3.  **Ephemeral Environments per Test Run (CI/CD):**
    *   **How:** Automatically provision a complete, isolated environment (e.g., using Kubernetes namespaces, Terraform, or specialized tools like Testcontainers) for each CI test run and tear it down afterwards.
    *   **Pros:** Best isolation. Highly repeatable. Scales well for parallel testing.
    *   **Cons:** Most complex setup. Can be slower to provision the environment for each run. Potential cost for cloud resources.
    *   **Tools:** Kubernetes, Terraform, Testcontainers, cloud provider CLIs/SDKs.

4.  **Hybrid Approach (Using Test Doubles):**
    *   **How:** Run the primary service(s) under test locally or in a dedicated environment, but replace some dependencies (especially slow, expensive, or unstable ones like third-party APIs) with mocks or stubs.
    *   **Pros:** Balances realism with speed and control. Reduces external dependencies.
    *   **Cons:** Doesn't test the *real* integration with the mocked components. Requires maintaining the test doubles.

## Key Considerations

*   **Configuration:** How will services in the test environment be configured (database connections, URLs for other services, credentials)? Use environment variables, configuration files mounted into containers, or service discovery mechanisms.
*   **Dependencies:** Identify all direct and indirect dependencies needed for the integration flows being tested (databases, caches, queues, other internal/external services).
*   **Networking:** Ensure components within the test environment can communicate with each other as needed (e.g., Docker container networking, VPC settings in the cloud).
*   **Data Seeding/Reset:** How will the necessary baseline data be populated before tests, and how will the environment be cleaned or reset between runs? (See `integration-test-data-strategies.md`).
*   **Secrets Management:** How will credentials for databases, mocked services, or real external APIs (if used) be securely provided to the test environment? Avoid hardcoding.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** How will the test environment be set up, tests executed, and results reported within the CI/CD pipeline? Coordinate with `cicd-specialist`.

The choice of environment strategy depends on factors like application architecture (monolith vs. microservices), team size, CI/CD infrastructure, budget, and the specific integration points being tested. Docker Compose offers a good starting point for local development and CI, while dedicated or ephemeral environments provide higher fidelity for later-stage testing.
