# Current Status & v7.0 Mode Refinement Plan

**Date:** 2025-04-13
**Status:** Planning

## 1. Current Status Summary

We are currently working on the `v7.0` branch, focusing on establishing a robust and well-defined set of Roo Commander modes based on the v7 hierarchy. Key activities completed so far include:

*   **Branching:** A fresh `v7.0` branch was created from `main`.
*   **Initial Mode Organization:** Draft modes were integrated, standard Lead modes were created, and file structures were adjusted based on initial reviews (`project_journal/reviews/20251204-v7.0-mode-review.md`). The `gcp-architect` mode was reclassified to `020-lead-devops`.
*   **Specification Updates:** Hierarchy and folder structure documents (`v7.0/templates/`) were updated to reflect the `0xx` naming convention for top-level directories (e.g., `01x-director`).
*   **Filename Corrections:** Inconsistent mode filenames (e.g., `angular-developer`, `animejs-specialist`) were corrected to use the standard hyphenated format.
*   **New Mode Templates:** Basic templates for requested new modes (AWS/Azure Architects, Security Lead, Auth Workers, MySQL Worker, AI/ML Workers) were created in appropriate new or existing department folders.
*   **Footgun Modes:** Advanced "Footgun" variants for Code, Architect, Debug, and Ask modes were created and expanded with detailed structure in `v7.0/modes/05x-footgun/`. Emojis were assigned (‚ö°Ô∏è, üèóÔ∏è, üî¨, üó£Ô∏è).
*   **Commander Logic Refined:** The initial interaction logic for `roo-commander` was updated to better recognize user intents related to refactoring, learning, and testing.
*   **Hybrid Context Strategy Planning:** We have explored the potential of the new `.roo` directory capabilities alongside the existing `project_journal`. Planning documents outlining a proposed hybrid strategy (`hybrid-context-strategy.md`), a mode manifest concept (`mode-manifest-org-chart.md`), and a communication plan (`mode-communication-plan.md`) have been created in `v7.0/future-planning/`. The agreed approach is to keep `project_journal` for core artifacts and use `.roo/context/` for mode-specific knowledge/cache.

## 2. Next Phase: Methodical Mode Refinement

While significant structural work and template creation have occurred, a comprehensive review and update of *each individual mode file* is required to ensure consistency, completeness, and alignment with the v7 standards and the hybrid context strategy.

**Goal:** To produce a fully documented, consistent, and operational v7.0 mode set, accurately reflected in a Mode Manifest / Org Chart.

**Proposed Plan:**

1.  **Master Task:** Create a new master task (or potentially repurpose/re-open `TASK-MODE-20251204-184100.md` with an updated scope) to track this overall refinement effort.
2.  **Sub-Task Generation:** For **each** mode file currently within `v7.0/modes/` (across all levels: 00x, 01x, 02x, 03x, 04x, 05x), create a dedicated sub-task (likely following MDTM format in `project_journal/tasks/`).
3.  **Sub-Task Scope (For Each Mode):**
    *   **Review Content:** Read the entire mode file (`read_file`).
    *   **Verify/Assign Emoji:** Confirm or assign an appropriate, standard emoji for the `name` field.
    *   **Ensure Standard Sections:** Verify all sections from `v7.0/templates/mode_template.md` are present (Description, Capabilities, Workflow, Role Definition, Custom Instructions [1-6], Metadata). Add missing sections with placeholder content if necessary.
    *   **Complete Core Content:** Ensure Description, Capabilities, Workflow, and Role Definition are accurate and reasonably detailed for the mode's function. *This includes fully developing the content for the newly created Lead and Worker templates.*
    *   **Complete Custom Instructions:** Populate all subsections (1-6) within Custom Instructions, ensuring alignment with Roo Commander principles (iterative tool use, journaling standards, clear reporting) and the mode's specific role. Add "Footgun" warnings/considerations where applicable.
    *   **Validate Metadata:**
        *   Confirm `Level` matches its directory structure.
        *   Review and update `Tags`, `Categories`, `Stack` for accuracy and completeness.
        *   **Crucially:** Verify and update `Delegates To`, `Escalates To`, `Reports To` based on the *full* set of v7.0 modes and the defined hierarchy/communication plan.
        *   Standardize `API Configuration` (e.g., default to `gemini-2.5-pro` unless a specific reason exists).
    *   **Identify `.roo/context/` Needs:** Determine if the mode would benefit from external knowledge bases or context files and note potential file paths within `.roo/context/{mode-slug}/` for future creation/reference.
    *   **Log Completion:** Update the sub-task status and log completion details.
4.  **Update Mode Manifest:** As each mode's review/update sub-task is completed, update the draft `v7.0/future-planning/mode-manifest-org-chart.md` with the verified emoji, description, and hierarchy information.
5.  **Delegation:** These sub-tasks can be assigned individually or in batches, likely to the `technical-writer` or a similar mode focused on documentation and consistency.

## 3. Outcome

Executing this plan will result in a high-quality, consistent, and well-documented v7.0 mode set, ready for packaging, testing, and use, along with a valuable manifest for user and AI reference. This methodical approach ensures all modes adhere to the defined standards and leverage the new context capabilities effectively.
