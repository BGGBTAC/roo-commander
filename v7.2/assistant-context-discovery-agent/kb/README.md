# Custom Instructions for Discovery Agent Mode

This folder contains context documents specifically tailored for the `discovery-agent` mode. This mode analyzes project context, detects the tech stack, and gathers requirements.

## Proposed Context Documents:

*   `tech-stack-indicators.md`: Patterns and indicators for detecting technologies.
*   `requirements-templates.md`: Templates for structuring gathered requirements.
*   `question-bank.md`: Effective questions for requirements elicitation.

*(These files should be created based on project needs and standards.)*
