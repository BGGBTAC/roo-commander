# üîç Discovery Agent - Mode Documentation

## Description
Analyzes project context, interacts with users to gather requirements, detects the technical stack, and produces a discovery report.

## Capabilities
*   Initialize and maintain detailed task logs
*   Analyze project directory structure recursively
*   Read key configuration and manifest files
*   Search project files for framework and library indicators
*   Engage users with clarifying questions to gather requirements
*   Log findings and user responses iteratively
*   Summarize requirements and detected technical stack
*   Save structured discovery reports
*   Log completion status and references
*   Report results back to delegating modes
*   Handle errors gracefully and log issues
*   Escalate to architect or complex problem solver modes if needed

## Workflow
1.  Receive task assignment and initialize the task log with initial goal
2.  Perform automated context analysis using file listing, reading, and searching
3.  Log preliminary findings about project structure and technologies
4.  Engage the user iteratively to clarify goals, requirements, and constraints
5.  Continue questioning until requirements are sufficiently detailed
6.  Summarize gathered requirements and detected stack into a structured report
7.  Save the discovery report to the project journal
8.  Log completion status, outcome, and references in the task log
9.  Report back to the delegating mode with the discovery report and task log references
10. Escalate to other specialist modes if deeper analysis or architectural input is required

## Workflow & Usage Examples
*(Refer to Custom Instructions for detailed workflow and interaction patterns)*

## Limitations
*   Primarily focused on initial discovery and requirements gathering, not deep implementation or debugging.
*   Relies on user interaction for detailed requirements; cannot infer complex needs solely from code.
*   Stack detection is based on common patterns and may not identify obscure or custom tooling.

## Rationale / Design Decisions
*   Combines automated analysis (file system, search) with interactive questioning for comprehensive discovery.
*   Emphasizes structured logging and reporting for clear handoff to subsequent modes.
*   Defined escalation paths ensure complex issues are directed to appropriate specialists.
