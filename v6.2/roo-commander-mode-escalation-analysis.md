# Roo Commander Mode Escalation & Specialist Handoff Analysis

## Context

- Roo Commander coordinates project tasks and delegates to various modes.
- Specialist modes exist for Tailwind, Bootstrap, React, Django, etc.
- Currently, **handoff to specialists relies heavily on initial user input or explicit delegation**.
- This can lead to **missed opportunities to leverage expertise**, especially when the user is unaware or forgets to request a specialist.
- The goal is to **improve proactive, intelligent escalation** to specialist modes during project execution.

---

## Current Weaknesses

- **Initial delegation is static**: Roo Commander assigns a mode based on initial intent, but rarely re-evaluates during execution.
- **Specialists are underutilized**: Tasks that would benefit from a specialist (e.g., Tailwind setup) are handled by generalists unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
- **Discovery is not fully leveraged**: Even if a discovery phase is run, its findings are not always used to dynamically adjust delegation.
- **Monolithic task handling**: Large tasks are handled by a single mode, rather than broken into subtasks for different experts.
- **User-driven escalation**: The system waits for the user to notice issues and request a specialist, leading to delays and errors.

## Proposed Multi-Layered Escalation Strategy

### 1. Early, Explicit Discovery Phase

- Always run a **discovery agent** early in onboarding or before major tasks.
- The discovery agent:
  - Analyzes files, configs, dependencies.
  - Detects tech stacks, frameworks, languages.
  - Flags potential problem areas.
  - Outputs a **stack profile** with **tags** (e.g., `"tailwind"`, `"react"`, `"django"`).
  - Suggests relevant specialist modes.

### 2. Metadata-Driven Specialist Matching

- Enhance all mode definitions with **`tags` metadata** indicating their expertise.
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "slug": "tailwind-specialist",
    "tags": ["tailwind", "css", "frontend"]
  }
  ```
- Discovery outputs detected tags.
- Roo Commander **matches detected tags to specialist modes**.

### 3. Dynamic Delegation & Escalation

- After discovery, Roo Commander:
  - **Maps detected tags to available specialists**.
  - **Splits complex tasks** into subtasks aligned with specialist expertise.
  - Delegates each subtask to the **most appropriate specialist**.
  - Coordinates the overall workflow, managing dependencies and integration.
- During task execution:
  - If a mode encounters a **tech-specific blocker**, it can **request escalation** to a specialist.
  - Roo Commander can **reassign or spawn subtasks** dynamically.

### 4. Multi-Specialist Collaboration

- Specialists can **further escalate**:
  - E.g., React specialist calls Tailwind specialist for styling.
  - Backend specialist calls database specialist for schema design.
- Roo Commander **tracks all subtasks** and **integrates outputs**.
- This enables **parallel, expert-driven development**.

### 5. User Control & Transparency

- Users can **override or guide** escalation preferences.
- The system **logs all escalations and delegations** clearly.
- Users can **review or adjust** specialist involvement as needed.

## Implementation Recommendations

### A. Enhance Mode Metadata

- Add **`tags`** to all mode definitions indicating tech expertise.
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "slug": "django-developer",
    "tags": ["django", "python", "backend"]
  }
  ```

### B. Improve Discovery Agent

- Ensure it outputs a **detailed stack profile** with tags.
- Include **confidence scores** or **priority hints**.
- Save discovery output to a **standardized context file**.

### C. Update Roo Commander Logic

- After onboarding/discovery:
  - **Parse the stack profile**.
  - **Identify matching specialists** for each tag.
  - **Split tasks** accordingly.
  - **Delegate subtasks** to specialists.
- During execution:
  - Allow modes to **request escalation** if they detect a need.
  - Roo Commander **reassigns or spawns** specialist subtasks dynamically.

### D. Encourage Specialists to Collaborate

- Specialists should be able to:
  - **Escalate to sub-specialists**.
  - **Request help** for specific components.
  - **Log dependencies** clearly.

### E. Maintain User Control

- Provide options to:
  - **Approve or override** escalations.
  - **Specify preferred specialists**.
  - **Review escalation history**.

## Considerations & Tradeoffs

- **Automation vs. User Control**: Balance proactive escalation with user preferences.
- **Task Fragmentation**: Avoid over-splitting tasks, which can increase coordination overhead.
- **Unknown or Mixed Stacks**: Fallback gracefully when no specialist exists.
- **Coordination Complexity**: Roo Commander must manage dependencies and integration carefully.
- **Transparency**: Log all escalations and decisions for auditability.

---

## Summary

- Proactive, metadata-driven escalation will **maximize specialist expertise**.
- Early discovery plus dynamic delegation enables **flexible, expert-driven workflows**.
- Roo Commander remains the **central coordinator**, managing multi-specialist collaboration.
- This approach reduces reliance on user intervention and **improves project quality and speed**.
