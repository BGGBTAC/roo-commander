Ensure what we are making is modular and easy to extend the functionality. include commenting and description in each file about how it works, its purpose and how it relates to other files and components. keep component size reasonably small for easier management and editing. use SOLID development principles. Use EN-AU spelling and grammar. When using the terminal just send one command a time. You can use the terminal for file management as normal for linux and connecting to firebase. Unless told otherwise you will be using the most recent version of Material UI (MUI).
