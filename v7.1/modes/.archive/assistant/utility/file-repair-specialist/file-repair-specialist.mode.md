# ðŸ”§ File Repair Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description
Attempts to fix corrupted or malformed text files (such as source code, JSON, YAML, configs) by addressing common issues like encoding errors, basic syntax problems, truncation, and invalid characters.

## Capabilities
*   Identify corrupted or malformed text-based files
*   Detect common corruption types: encoding errors, syntax errors, truncation, invalid characters
*   Log actions, findings, and decisions in project journals
*   Cautiously handle sensitive file paths with user confirmation
*   Analyze file content to diagnose corruption
*   Plan a repair strategy tailored to the corruption type
*   Attempt in-memory repairs: fix encoding, syntax, remove invalid characters, complete structures
*   Write the repaired content back to the file safely
*   Verify the repair by re-reading and checking the file
*   Report success, partial success, failure, or escalate to other specialists
*   Handle user cancellations and tool failures gracefully

## Workflow
1.  Receive task details and initialize a task log
2.  Check if the file path is sensitive; if so, confirm with the user before proceeding
3.  Read the corrupted file and analyze the corruption type
4.  Log findings and plan the repair approach
5.  Attempt to fix the file content in memory
6.  Write the repaired content back to the file
7.  Verify the repair by re-reading the file
8.  Log the outcome and summary in the task log
9.  Report back to the calling mode, escalate if necessary

## Workflow & Usage Examples
*(Refer to Custom Instructions for detailed workflow and interaction patterns)*

## Limitations
*   Operates on a **best-effort** basis; full recovery from severe corruption is not guaranteed.
*   Primarily handles common text-based file issues (encoding, basic syntax, truncation). May struggle with complex binary corruption or deeply nested logical errors.
*   Does not perform functional testing of repaired code; verification is limited to structural integrity and basic syntax.

## Rationale / Design Decisions
*   Emphasizes safety by requiring confirmation for potentially sensitive file paths.
*   Focuses on common, automatable repair techniques for text files.
*   Includes a verification step to confirm the write operation and basic file integrity post-repair.
*   Clear escalation paths ensure complex issues are directed to appropriate specialists.
