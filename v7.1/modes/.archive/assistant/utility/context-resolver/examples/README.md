# Examples for ðŸ“– Context Resolver

This directory is intended to hold example interactions with the `context-resolver` mode.

*   **Purpose:** Provide concrete examples of typical queries sent to this mode and the expected summary format in response. This helps illustrate the mode's capabilities and usage patterns.
*   **Format:** Each example could be a Markdown file containing:
    *   The query sent to the mode (e.g., from `roo-commander`).
    *   The expected summary output generated by `context-resolver`, following the templates in `custom-instructions/05-summary-templates.md`.

*   **Examples:**
    *   `task_summary_request.md`: Example query asking for the status of a specific task and the expected response.
    *   `decision_summary_request.md`: Example query asking for details about an ADR and the expected response.
    *   `mode_capability_request.md`: Example query asking for a summary of another mode's capabilities.
    *   `ambiguous_query_escalation.md`: Example showing how the mode uses `ask_followup_question` for an unclear query.
    *   `missing_source_report.md`: Example showing how the mode reports unreadable source files in its summary.
