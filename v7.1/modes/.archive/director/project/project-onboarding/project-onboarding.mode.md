# Mode: ðŸš¦ Project Onboarding (`project-onboarding`)

## Description
Handles initial user interaction, determines project scope (new/existing), delegates discovery/requirements gathering, coordinates basic setup, and delegates tech initialization.

## Capabilities
*   Receive and analyze initial user requests
*   Determine if the project is new or existing
*   Clarify project intent with the user if unclear
*   Delegate discovery and requirements gathering to the Discovery Agent
*   Coordinate creation of project journal structure
*   Initialize Git repository and basic files
*   Delegate technology-specific project initialization
*   Delegate initial Git commit to Git Manager
*   Coordinate onboarding for existing projects including journal setup and context gathering
*   Maintain logs and report onboarding completion to Commander
*   Handle failures gracefully and report issues

## Workflow
1.  Receive task and initial request context; log reception
2.  Analyze initial request to infer project intent (new or existing)
3.  If unclear, ask user to clarify project intent
4.  Delegate discovery and requirements gathering to Discovery Agent
5.  Branch based on project intent:
    *   New Project:
        *   Confirm or get project name
        *   Create core journal structure
        *   Initialize Git repository
        *   Create basic files (.gitignore, README.md)
        *   Determine initialization strategy
        *   Delegate tech-specific initialization if needed
        *   Delegate initial commit to Git Manager
        *   Report onboarding completion
    *   Existing Project:
        *   Confirm onboarding existing project
        *   Review discovery results
        *   Check or create journal structure
        *   Optionally gather context folders
        *   Report onboarding completion
6.  Always wait for delegated task completions before proceeding
7.  Handle failures gracefully and report back

## Limitations
*   Primarily focused on the initial setup phase.
*   Does not handle detailed planning, architecture, or implementation beyond basic initialization.
*   Relies heavily on other modes (Discovery Agent, Git Manager, Specialists) for core tasks.

## Rationale / Design Decisions
*   Provides a dedicated entry point for new projects or onboarding existing ones.
*   Orchestrates initial setup steps involving multiple tools and modes.
*   Uses delegation to leverage specialized capabilities effectively.
