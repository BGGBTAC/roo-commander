# ðŸ‘€ Code Reviewer - Mode Documentation

## Description

Reviews code changes for quality, standards adherence, bugs, security, performance, maintainability, and provides actionable feedback.

## Capabilities

*   Review code changes for correctness, standards compliance, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, maintainability, readability, testability, and documentation accuracy.
*   Analyze code context using file reading, code structure listing, and pattern searching.
*   Run static analysis tools and execute tests via command line.
*   Provide structured, actionable feedback with clear explanations and concrete code examples.
*   Log goals, actions, feedback, and completion status in project journals (if applicable based on project setup).
*   Save formal review reports to project documentation (if applicable based on project setup).
*   Decide on review outcomes: approve, approve with suggestions, request changes, or reject.
*   Escalate issues to specialized modes such as architect, security specialist, bug fixer, or tester.
*   Collaborate with development, testing, architecture, security, performance, and documentation modes.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

### High-Level Workflow

1.  Receive task assignment (e.g., PR link, file paths) and context (standards, requirements).
2.  Analyze code and related context using available tools (read files, list definitions, search patterns, run static analysis).
3.  Review code systematically against key criteria (correctness, standards, security, performance, maintainability, testability, documentation).
4.  Formulate structured, actionable feedback with specific references and suggestions.
5.  Determine the review outcome (Approve, Approve w/ Suggestions, Request Changes, Reject).
6.  Save/report the review feedback and outcome.
7.  Escalate issues exceeding scope to specialized modes if necessary.

### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Review a Pull Request**

```prompt
Review PR #123 (branch: feature/user-auth) for the new authentication module. Focus on security, adherence to our Python coding standards (`.docs/standards/python_standard.md`), and test coverage. Provide actionable feedback. Task ID: TSK-456.
```

**Example 2: Review Specific Files**

```prompt
Review the changes in `src/utils/data_processor.js` and `tests/utils/data_processor.test.js`. Check for correctness, potential performance issues with large datasets, and maintainability. Task ID: TSK-457.
```

**Example 3: Escalate a Security Concern**

```prompt
During the review of PR #123 (Task TSK-456), I identified a potential SQL injection vulnerability in `src/models/user.py` line 75. Please escalate this to the Security Specialist for deeper analysis.
```

## Limitations

*   Focuses primarily on code review aspects (quality, standards, security, performance, maintainability, testability, documentation).
*   Escalates issues outside its core expertise (e.g., major architectural flaws, complex performance tuning, novel security exploits) to appropriate specialist modes.
*   Relies on provided project standards and context; identifies lack of standards but does not typically create them.
*   Does not perform primary development, design, extensive testing execution (beyond running existing tests), or documentation authoring, but collaborates closely with modes responsible for these tasks.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** A dedicated Code Reviewer mode ensures thorough, consistent, and expert focus on code quality and adherence to standards across the project.
*   **Structured Feedback:** Emphasizing actionable feedback with clear examples and specific references improves the efficiency of the development cycle by making issues easier to understand and address.
*   **Collaboration & Escalation:** Defined pathways for collaboration and escalation ensure that complex or specialized issues identified during review are efficiently routed to the modes best equipped to handle them (e.g., Security Specialist, Technical Architect).
