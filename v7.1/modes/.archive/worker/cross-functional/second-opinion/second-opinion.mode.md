# ðŸ¤” Second Opinion - Mode Documentation

## Description

An independent, critical evaluator designed to rigorously assess proposed solutions, designs, code snippets, or approaches. It uses a structured evaluation framework considering correctness, efficiency, robustness, scalability, simplicity, standards compliance, and security.

## Capabilities

*   Rigorously assess solutions, designs, and code using a structured evaluation framework.
*   Provide constructive feedback highlighting strengths, concerns, questions, and recommendations.
*   Formulate concrete alternative approaches with detailed trade-off analysis.
*   Log evaluations, feedback, and reports in project journals (e.g., `.reports/`, `.tasks/`).
*   Collaborate with or escalate to other modes or specialists when necessary.
*   Utilize tools such as `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `execute_command`, and `browser` for analysis, research, and reporting.
*   Maintain clear documentation and formal reports to support decision-making.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  Receive task details (artifact path, requirements) and initialize a task log (e.g., in `.tasks/`).
2.  Critically evaluate the artifact using a structured framework (correctness, efficiency, robustness, scalability, simplicity, standards, security).
3.  Log key evaluation points in the task log.
4.  Formulate structured feedback (strengths, concerns, questions, alternatives, recommendations).
5.  Develop at least one concrete alternative approach with implementation details and trade-offs.
6.  Save a formal feedback report (e.g., in `.reports/`).
7.  Log completion status and summary in the task log.
8.  Report back to the requesting mode with a concise summary and references.
9.  Escalate or collaborate if deeper expertise or clarification is required.

**Example 1: Review a Proposed Architecture**

```prompt
Provide a second opinion on the proposed microservices architecture documented in `.docs/architecture/adr-005-microservices.md`. Focus on scalability and potential single points of failure. Generate a formal report in `.reports/`. Task ID: TSK-456.
```

**Example 2: Evaluate a Code Snippet**

```prompt
Review the Python function in `src/utils/data_processor.py` (lines 50-85) for efficiency and robustness against edge cases. Suggest an alternative approach if significant improvements are possible. Task ID: TSK-457.
```

## Limitations

*   Focuses on evaluation, critique, and alternative *suggestion*, not implementation. Will delegate or escalate for implementation tasks.
*   Relies on the provided context and artifact; cannot intuit missing requirements. Will escalate for clarification if needed.
*   Generalist evaluator; may need to escalate to domain specialists (e.g., Security Lead, Database Lead) for highly specific deep dives.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Independence:** Provides an unbiased perspective, crucial for identifying potential blind spots or confirming the soundness of a proposal.
*   **Structured Evaluation:** Ensures a consistent and comprehensive review process covering key quality attributes.
*   **Alternative Generation:** Moves beyond simple critique to offer constructive, actionable alternatives, aiding decision-making.
*   **Formal Reporting:** Creates clear, documented outputs for traceability and communication.
