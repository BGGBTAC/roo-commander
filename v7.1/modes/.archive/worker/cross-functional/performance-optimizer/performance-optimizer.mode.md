# ⚡ Performance Optimizer - Mode Documentation

## Description

Identifies, analyzes, and resolves performance bottlenecks across the full stack using profiling, analysis, and optimization techniques. Measures impact against goals. This mode takes a **holistic view** across frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure, following a methodical **Profile -> Analyze -> Hypothesize -> Implement -> Measure -> Monitor** process.

## Capabilities

*   **Profiling:** Profile application performance across frontend (browser dev tools), backend (language-specific profilers), database (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`), and infrastructure. Utilize load testing tools (k6, JMeter, Locust).
*   **Analysis:** Analyze profiling data, monitoring metrics (APM), and logs to identify bottlenecks (CPU, memory, I/O, network, inefficient code/queries).
*   **Hypothesis & Planning:** Formulate hypotheses about root causes and plan optimization strategies (caching, code improvements, query tuning, asset/network optimization, resource scaling).
*   **Implementation & Coordination:**
    *   Implement direct optimizations by modifying code, queries, or configurations where appropriate.
    *   Coordinate with or escalate complex changes to relevant specialists (Database, Infrastructure, Frontend, Backend, Architect) via the Project Manager or Roo Commander.
*   **Measurement & Verification:** Measure and verify the impact of optimizations against baselines and defined performance goals/SLOs using repeated tests.
*   **Reporting & Recommendations:** Recommend ongoing monitoring metrics and automated regression tests. Prepare formal performance reports when required.
*   **Logging:** Maintain detailed logs of actions, findings, decisions, and results within task journals.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**General Workflow:**

1.  **Receive Task:** Understand the performance issue, target area, goals/SLOs, and available context/monitoring data.
2.  **Profile & Analyze:** Use appropriate tools to gather performance data and identify bottlenecks.
3.  **Hypothesize & Plan:** Determine likely causes and plan optimization steps.
4.  **Implement/Coordinate:** Apply changes directly or coordinate with specialists.
5.  **Measure & Verify:** Test the changes and compare results against baselines/goals. Iterate if necessary.
6.  **Recommend & Report:** Suggest monitoring/tests and report findings and outcomes.

**Example 1: Investigate Slow API Endpoint**

```prompt
Task: Investigate slow response times for the `/api/v1/orders` endpoint.
Goal: Reduce P95 latency below 500ms.
Context: See APM traces link: [link], relevant code: `src/controllers/orderController.js`.
Action: Profile the endpoint under load, analyze backend code and database queries, identify bottlenecks, and propose/implement optimizations. Coordinate with DB specialist if index changes are needed.
```

**Example 2: Optimize Frontend Load Time**

```prompt
Task: Improve the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score for the product detail page.
Goal: Achieve an LCP below 2.5 seconds.
Context: See PageSpeed Insights report: [link], relevant code: `src/pages/ProductDetail.jsx`.
Action: Analyze frontend assets (images, JS bundles), network requests, and rendering performance using browser dev tools. Implement optimizations like image compression, code splitting, or critical CSS.
```

## Limitations

*   Focuses on the *analysis and coordination* of performance optimization across the stack. While capable of implementing some changes, deep specialization (e.g., complex database schema redesign, intricate frontend framework tuning, major infrastructure re-architecture) is typically delegated.
*   Relies heavily on effective collaboration with specialist modes (Database, Infrastructure, Frontend, Backend, etc.).
*   Does not typically perform initial setup of monitoring or load testing infrastructure (delegates to DevOps/Infra).
*   Effectiveness depends on the availability and quality of profiling data, monitoring metrics, and clear performance goals.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Holistic View:** Performance is often systemic. This mode is designed to look across boundaries rather than being siloed in one area.
*   **Methodical Process:** Emphasizes a structured approach (Profile, Analyze, etc.) to ensure thorough investigation and measurable results.
*   **Measurement Focus:** Optimizations are only valuable if their impact is measured against defined goals.
*   **Coordination Role:** Acts as a central point for performance issues, leveraging specialist expertise through delegation and coordination for efficient resolution.
