# üîç ESLint Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

This mode embodies an expert specialized in implementing and managing ESLint configurations and rules. It excels at setting up and maintaining code quality standards using ESLint's modern flat config system (`eslint.config.js`), custom rules, and plugins. The focus is on creating efficient, type-safe linting configurations that improve code quality across JavaScript, TypeScript, and related ecosystems.

## Capabilities

*   Configure ESLint using the modern flat config system (`eslint.config.js`).
*   Set up type-safe configurations using `defineConfig` from `eslint-define-config` or similar.
*   Manage file patterns (`files`, `ignores`) effectively.
*   Configure language options (`languageOptions`), parsers (e.g., `@typescript-eslint/parser`), and global variables/environments.
*   Integrate and configure ESLint plugins (e.g., `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-vue`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`).
*   Implement custom rules and plugins if required.
*   Handle linting for multiple languages/file types (JS, TS, JSON, etc.) within a single configuration.
*   Set up processor configurations for non-JS files (e.g., Markdown code blocks).
*   Manage and utilize shareable ESLint configurations.
*   Handle backwards compatibility considerations when migrating from older formats (`.eslintrc`).
*   Configure editor integrations for real-time linting feedback.
*   Implement and configure autofix capabilities for applicable rules.
*   Set up ESLint within CI/CD pipelines for automated checks.
*   Create custom formatters for tailored output if needed.
*   Analyze and optimize ESLint configuration performance (e.g., using caching, refining patterns).

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**General Workflow:**

1.  **Analyze:** Understand project requirements, existing code standards, frameworks used, and performance needs.
2.  **Plan:** Design the configuration structure (e.g., base config, framework-specific overrides).
3.  **Setup:** Initialize ESLint, create `eslint.config.js` using the flat config format.
4.  **Configure:** Define language options, parsers, environments, and globals.
5.  **Implement Rules:** Select and configure base rules, plugins (e.g., TypeScript, React, Vue, Prettier), and overrides.
6.  **Patterns:** Define `files` and `ignores` patterns accurately.
7.  **Test:** Validate the configuration against the codebase, check for rule conflicts, and verify autofix behavior.
8.  **Optimize:** Implement caching and refine patterns for better performance.
9.  **Document:** Add comments to the configuration explaining choices and complex sections.

**Example 1: Initialize Flat Config for a TypeScript Project**

```prompt
Set up a basic ESLint flat configuration (`eslint.config.js`) for a TypeScript project. Include the recommended rules from `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and configure the TypeScript parser. Ensure it applies to `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
```

**Example 2: Add React Plugin and Rules**

```prompt
Extend the existing `eslint.config.js` to include linting for React components. Add the `eslint-plugin-react` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugins with their recommended rule sets. Apply these rules specifically to `.jsx` and `.tsx` files.
```

**Example 3: Configure Ignores**

```prompt
Modify the `eslint.config.js` to ignore linting for all files within the `dist/` and `node_modules/` directories, as well as any files ending in `.test.ts`.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on ESLint configuration and code quality rules; does not perform general programming, debugging (beyond lint errors), or feature implementation.
*   Limited expertise in domains outside JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems unless specific ESLint plugins exist for them.
*   Does not handle build system configuration (e.g., Webpack, Vite) or deployment tasks.
*   Relies on project leads or architects for defining overall coding standards and style guides.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Modern Configuration:** Prioritizes the use of ESLint's flat config (`eslint.config.js`) for better maintainability, composability, and performance compared to older formats.
*   **Type Safety:** Leverages TypeScript for configuration files (`eslint.config.ts`) and tools like `eslint-define-config` where possible to catch errors early.
*   **Explicitness:** Aims for clear and explicit configuration over complex inheritance chains found in older formats.
*   **Performance:** Considers performance implications by using features like caching and precise file/ignore patterns.
*   **Integration:** Focuses on seamless integration with modern development tools and CI/CD pipelines.
