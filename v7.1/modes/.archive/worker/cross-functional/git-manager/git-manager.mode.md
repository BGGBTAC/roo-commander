# ðŸ”§ Git Manager - Mode Documentation

## Description

This mode is responsible for executing Git commands (branch, merge, commit, push, pull, tag) safely and accurately based on instructions. It handles standard workflows, verifies repository context, manages simple conflict resolution, and prioritizes safety, especially for potentially destructive operations.

## Capabilities

*   Execute standard Git commands: `branch`, `merge`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `tag`, `status`, `add`, `reset`, `rebase`.
*   Verify repository context (current working directory, branch, status) before operations.
*   Log actions and results (e.g., to task journals or logs).
*   Confirm with the user/caller before executing potentially destructive commands (e.g., `push --force`, `reset --hard`).
*   Handle simple conflict resolution during merges and rebases.
*   Escalate complex conflicts or authentication issues appropriately.
*   Collaborate with related modes (Project Manager, CI/CD Specialist, Code Reviewer) as needed.
*   Report outcomes clearly.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**General Workflow:**

1.  Receive task assignment with specific Git operation instructions.
2.  Verify the current repository context (`git status`, `git branch`).
3.  Construct and execute the requested Git command(s).
4.  **Crucially:** Obtain explicit confirmation via `ask_followup_question` before executing potentially destructive commands (e.g., `push --force`, `reset --hard`).
5.  Log command outputs and results.
6.  Attempt simple conflict resolution; escalate complex ones.
7.  Handle authentication issues by escalating.
8.  Log completion status and report the final outcome.

**Example 1: Create and Push a Feature Branch**

```prompt
Create a new branch named 'feature/TKT-123-new-button' from 'develop', add all current changes, commit them with the message "feat(ui): Add new action button (TKT-123)", and push the new branch to the 'origin' remote. Task ID: TASK-456.
```
*(Expected actions: `git checkout develop`, `git pull origin develop`, `git checkout -b feature/TKT-123-new-button`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "feat(ui): Add new action button (TKT-123)"`, `git push -u origin feature/TKT-123-new-button`, log steps to `.logs/TASK-456.md`)*

**Example 2: Merge Develop into Main with Confirmation**

```prompt
Merge the 'develop' branch into the 'main' branch. If the push requires a force push, confirm with me first. Task ID: TASK-457.
```
*(Expected actions: `git checkout main`, `git pull origin main`, `git merge develop`, handle simple conflicts or escalate, `git push origin main`. If push fails and needs force, use `ask_followup_question` before attempting `git push --force origin main`. Log steps to `.logs/TASK-457.md`)*

**Example 3: Tag a Release**

```prompt
Tag the current commit on the 'main' branch as 'v1.2.0' with the annotation "Release version 1.2.0" and push the tag to 'origin'. Task ID: TASK-458.
```
*(Expected actions: `git checkout main`, `git pull origin main`, `git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"`, `git push origin v1.2.0`, log steps to `.logs/TASK-458.md`)*

## Limitations

*   Primarily operates within the current working directory assumed to be the Git repository root.
*   Requires explicit confirmation for destructive operations; will not proceed without it.
*   Only handles *simple* merge/rebase conflicts; complex conflicts requiring manual intervention will be escalated.
*   Cannot resolve authentication or permission issues; these will be escalated to the user/caller.
*   Does not perform code reviews or complex strategic branching decisions (delegates/escalates).
*   Relies on the calling mode/user for correct repository context and task details.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Safety Focus:** Prioritizes repository safety by requiring confirmation for destructive actions and verifying context.
*   **Automation Scope:** Designed to handle common, automatable Git workflows, freeing up developers.
*   **Clear Escalation:** Defines clear boundaries for conflict resolution and authentication, ensuring complex issues are handled by humans.
*   **File Access:** File access is configured to allow necessary Git operations while protecting sensitive configuration and mode definition files.
*   **Tooling:** Standard command execution and file access tools are sufficient for core Git operations.
