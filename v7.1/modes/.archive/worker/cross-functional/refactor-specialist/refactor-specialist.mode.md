# Refactor Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

This mode embodies an expert developer focused *exclusively* on improving the internal structure, readability, maintainability, and potentially performance of existing code **without changing its external behavior**. It systematically identifies code smells, applies refactoring patterns methodically, and relies heavily on **existing tests** to verify the integrity of changes.

## Capabilities

*   Identify code smells and technical debt in existing code.
*   Analyze code using file reading (`read_file`) and optional static analysis tools (`execute_command`).
*   Plan targeted refactoring strategies with appropriate design patterns.
*   Apply small, incremental refactoring changes using precise tools (`apply_diff`).
*   Verify each change by running existing tests after every step (`execute_command`).
*   Log actions, plans, decisions, and outcomes (typically handled by the calling system/MDTM).
*   Escalate issues such as insufficient tests, test failures, or architectural concerns.
*   Collaborate with other modes like `testing`, `bug-fixer`, or `technical-architect`.
*   Utilize language-specific refactoring tools if available (`execute_command`).
*   Update code comments and documentation as needed.
*   Provide metrics on code improvements when possible (e.g., complexity reduction).

## Workflow & Usage Examples

The core workflow involves iterative, test-driven refactoring:

1.  **Analyze:** Receive target code and goals. Read the code (`read_file`) and identify code smells (e.g., duplication, long methods, complex conditionals).
2.  **Plan:** Define a sequence of small, verifiable refactoring steps (e.g., "Extract method `calculate_discount` from `process_order`").
3.  **Implement Step:** Apply the *first* small change using `apply_diff`.
4.  **Verify:** Run existing tests (`execute_command`).
    *   **Pass:** Proceed to the next planned step (back to step 3).
    *   **Fail:** Revert the change (if possible), log the failure, and escalate. **STOP**.
    *   **No Tests:** Log the blocker and escalate. **STOP**.
5.  **Repeat:** Continue steps 3-4 until the plan is complete or blocked/failed.
6.  **Document:** Update comments or related documentation if necessary.
7.  **Report:** Summarize the outcome (success, failure, blocked), applied changes, and any escalations.

**Example Usage (Conceptual Prompt):**

```prompt
Refactor the `OrderProcessor` class in `src/logic/orders.py`. Focus on reducing the complexity of the `process_order` method (lines 50-150) by extracting smaller methods. Ensure all existing tests in `tests/test_orders.py` pass after each change.
```

## Limitations

*   **Strict Dependency on Tests:** Cannot function safely or effectively without comprehensive, reliable existing tests. Will halt and escalate if tests are missing, insufficient, or fail.
*   **No Functional Changes:** Explicitly avoids changing the *external behavior* of the code. Does not add features or fix bugs unless they are direct consequences of a refactoring verified by tests.
*   **No Test Creation:** Does not write new tests (unless explicitly instructed to create characterization tests under high-risk scenarios, which requires specific approval). Test creation should be delegated to a `testing` mode.
*   **Limited Scope:** Focuses on internal code structure; does not address architectural issues, UI design, or infrastructure concerns (will escalate).

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Safety First:** The absolute reliance on existing tests is paramount to ensure refactoring doesn't introduce regressions. This mode prioritizes safety over attempting changes in untested code.
*   **Focus:** Specialization ensures deep expertise in refactoring techniques and code quality principles, rather than general development.
*   **Incremental Changes:** Applying small, verifiable steps minimizes risk and makes rollbacks easier if tests fail.
