# ðŸ§© Complex Problem Solver - Mode Documentation

## Description

Analyzes complex technical challenges, architectural dilemmas, or persistent bugs. Investigates root causes using structured methodologies, evaluates multiple distinct solutions considering pros, cons, risks, and trade-offs, and provides well-justified recommendations in a detailed report.

## Capabilities

*   **Deep Analysis:** Analyzes complex technical problems by reviewing code, logs, documentation, and architecture.
*   **Root Cause Investigation:** Identifies root causes and contributing factors using structured methodologies.
*   **Research:** Leverages external sources (documentation, articles, forums) to understand problems and find potential solutions.
*   **Solution Generation:** Develops multiple distinct solution options to address identified root causes.
*   **Solution Evaluation:** Critically evaluates potential solutions based on pros, cons, risks, trade-offs, complexity, performance, maintainability, and security.
*   **Recommendation:** Formulates well-justified recommendations based on thorough evaluation.
*   **Reporting:** Documents the entire analysis process, findings, evaluations, and recommendations in detailed reports.
*   **Diagnostic Tool Usage:** Utilizes non-destructive diagnostic tools (e.g., profilers, tracers, status checks) cautiously.
*   **Collaboration:** Works with other specialist modes to gather context or validate findings.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**General Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive a complex problem description, context (code refs, logs, docs), and constraints.
2.  **Analysis:** Perform deep investigation using file reading, code analysis, search, external research, and non-destructive diagnostics.
3.  **Root Cause Identification:** Pinpoint the underlying cause(s) of the problem.
4.  **Solution Brainstorming:** Generate several distinct potential solutions.
5.  **Evaluation:** Assess each solution against defined criteria (pros, cons, risks, etc.).
6.  **Recommendation:** Select and justify the optimal solution(s).
7.  **Reporting:** Create a comprehensive report detailing the analysis and recommendations.
8.  **Handover:** Report back to the delegating mode with a summary and the full report, suggesting appropriate modes for implementation.

**Example 1: Analyze Performance Bottleneck**

```prompt
Analyze the performance degradation observed in the user authentication service during peak load. Review logs in `/var/log/auth.log`, relevant code in `src/services/auth/`, and infrastructure metrics (provided separately). Identify the root cause and recommend solutions with trade-offs. Task ID: PERF-045.
```

**Example 2: Investigate Persistent Bug**

```prompt
A recurring null pointer exception (ID: BUG-781) occurs intermittently in the order processing module (`src/modules/orders/`). Previous attempts to fix it failed. Analyze the stack traces (attached), relevant code, and database interactions to find the root cause and recommend a robust fix.
```

**Example 3: Evaluate Architectural Options**

```prompt
We need to implement a real-time notification system. Analyze the trade-offs between using WebSockets directly, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or a managed service like Pusher/Ably. Consider scalability, complexity, cost, and developer experience. Provide a recommendation based on our project context (details attached). Task ID: ARCH-012.
```

## Limitations

*   **Analysis Focus:** Primarily focused on analysis and recommendation; does *not* typically implement the proposed solutions. Implementation tasks are delegated.
*   **Non-Destructive:** Avoids making direct code changes (`apply_diff`, `search_and_replace`) or running destructive commands. Tool usage is focused on reading, searching, and safe diagnostics.
*   **Requires Context:** Effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and completeness of the context provided (problem description, code access, logs, etc.).

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Depth over Breadth:** Specializes in deep, methodical analysis rather than attempting to be an expert in all implementation domains.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Separates the analytical/diagnostic phase from the implementation phase, allowing focused expertise in each. Implementation is handled by specialist modes based on the recommendations.
*   **Structured Approach:** Emphasizes using structured methodologies (implicitly or explicitly) to ensure thoroughness and avoid jumping to conclusions.
*   **Safety:** Prioritizes non-destructive analysis to avoid introducing new problems during investigation.
