# üêõ Bug Fixer - Mode Documentation

## Description

This mode embodies an expert software debugger specializing in systematic problem diagnosis and resolution. It meticulously identifies, reproduces, diagnoses the root cause of, and resolves software bugs reported in applications or systems. It implements robust fixes, creates effective regression tests to prevent recurrence, and verifies the solution thoroughly. This mode handles various bug types, including functional, performance, and potential security issues.

## Capabilities

*   **Bug Identification & Reproduction:** Systematically identifies and reproduces reported software bugs based on provided information (logs, error messages, user reports).
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Analyzes logs, error messages, code sections, and uses debugging tools/techniques to pinpoint the underlying cause of a bug.
*   **Code Fixing:** Implements targeted and robust code fixes that address the identified root cause, adhering to project coding standards and best practices.
*   **Regression Testing:** Creates new or modifies existing automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) to specifically cover the bug scenario, ensuring it doesn't reappear.
*   **Verification:** Runs relevant test suites (regression tests, full suites) to confirm the fix is effective and hasn't introduced new issues.
*   **Collaboration:** Works with testing modes to verify fixes and consults framework/language specialists or architects for complex issues.
*   **Documentation:** Maintains clear records of the debugging process, findings, fix implementation, and verification results (often via task logs).

## Workflow & Usage Examples

The typical workflow involves receiving a bug report, reproducing the issue, diagnosing the cause, implementing a fix, adding a regression test, verifying the solution, and reporting the outcome.

**Example 1: Fix a Null Pointer Exception**

```prompt
Investigate and fix Bug #451 (reported in JIRA). Logs attached show a NullPointerException in `UserService.java:152` when updating user profiles with missing optional fields. Please add a regression test. Task ID: TSK-BUG-001
```

**Example 2: Address Incorrect Calculation**

```prompt
The `calculateDiscount` function in `src/utils/pricing.js` is applying the wrong discount percentage for bulk orders (over 100 items). See task TSK-BUG-002 for details and reproduction steps. Fix the logic and add a unit test covering this scenario.
```

**Example 3: Investigate Frontend Rendering Glitch**

```prompt
Users report a visual glitch on the dashboard (`/components/DashboardWidgets.jsx`) after the latest deployment (see attached screenshot). It seems related to asynchronous data loading. Please find the root cause, fix it, and ensure existing E2E tests pass. Task ID: TSK-BUG-003
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on fixing existing code; does not typically implement new features.
*   Relies on clear bug reports, logs, and reproduction steps for efficient diagnosis. Ambiguous reports may require clarification or escalation.
*   May escalate bugs rooted in fundamental architectural flaws, complex performance issues, or security vulnerabilities to specialized modes (e.g., `technical-architect`, `performance-optimizer`, `security-specialist`).
*   Scope is generally limited to code and test modifications; does not handle infrastructure or deployment issues directly (will escalate to `devops-lead` or `infrastructure-specialist`).

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Systematic Approach:** Emphasizes a structured process (reproduce, diagnose, fix, test, verify) for reliable bug resolution.
*   **Regression Testing Focus:** Prioritizes adding automated tests to prevent bug recurrence, improving long-term code quality.
*   **Clear Escalation Paths:** Defines when to hand off issues to specialists, ensuring complex problems are handled by the appropriate expert.
*   **Tool Proficiency:** Assumes proficiency with standard development tools (reading files, editing code, running commands/tests) necessary for debugging tasks.
