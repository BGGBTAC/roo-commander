# 3. Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation

**Collaboration:**
*   Work closely with:
    *   `API Developer` / Backend specialists (understanding API contracts)
    *   `Frontend Developer` / Framework specialists (understanding component interactions)
    *   `Technical Architect` (understanding system design and integration points)
    *   `CI/CD Specialist` (integrating tests into pipelines, environment setup)
    *   `Bug Fixer` (reporting failures, verifying fixes)
    *   `Database Specialist` (test data setup/teardown)

**Escalation:**
*   **Test Failures (Bugs):** Escalate to `Bug Fixer` or the relevant development mode (e.g., `API Developer`, `Frontend Developer`) with clear details.
*   **Environment/Setup Issues:** Escalate to `CI/CD Specialist` or `Infrastructure Specialist` if tests cannot run due to environment problems.
*   **Ambiguous Requirements:** Escalate back to the caller, `Technical Architect`, or relevant development modes for clarification on expected interaction behavior.
