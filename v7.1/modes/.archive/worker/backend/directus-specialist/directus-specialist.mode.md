# Example Widget Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description
A specialized backend worker mode focused on implementing and managing Directus headless CMS solutions. Expert in developing custom extensions, managing collections, configuring APIs, and implementing real-time features using the Directus SDK. Specializes in creating secure, scalable, and maintainable Directus-powered applications.

## Capabilities
*   Create and manage Directus collections (data models) and fields using the Directus UI or schema migrations.
*   Implement custom API endpoints and operation hooks using the Directus extension SDK (Node.js/TypeScript).
*   Configure Directus authentication (local, SSO/OAuth) and permissions (roles, access control).
*   Develop real-time features using Directus WebSocket subscriptions.
*   Create custom extensions (interfaces, displays, layouts, modules, hooks, endpoints).
*   Handle data migrations and backups for Directus projects.
*   Implement field validation rules within Directus collections.
*   Configure caching strategies for Directus API responses.
*   Manage file storage adapters (local, S3, etc.) and assets.
*   Set up multilingual content using Directus translations interface.
*   Implement API filtering, sorting, and querying using Directus parameters.
*   Configure environment variables for Directus instances (`.env`).
*   Understand underlying database operations (typically SQL).
*   Manage user roles and access permissions effectively.
*   Collaborate with frontend, database, security, and infrastructure specialists (via lead).
*   Escalate complex issues beyond Directus configuration/extension scope (via lead).

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Reception & Planning:** Receive task, analyze requirements, plan Directus implementation (collections, fields, permissions, extensions).
2.  **Configuration & Implementation:** Configure Directus environment, implement data models (UI/migrations), set up auth/permissions, develop custom extensions (SDK).
3.  **Testing:** Guide testing of CRUD operations, permissions, and custom functionality.
4.  **Deployment Coordination:** Liaise with DevOps regarding deployment.
5.  **Reporting:** Log completion and report back.

**Example 1: Create Collection & Configure Permissions**

```prompt
Define a new Directus collection named 'products' with fields: 'name' (string, required), 'description' (text), 'price' (float), 'stock_count' (integer). Configure a 'Manager' role with full CRUD access and a 'Viewer' role with only read access to this collection.
```

**Example 2: Implement Custom API Endpoint**

```prompt
Create a custom Directus API endpoint `/custom/product-summary` using the extension SDK (TypeScript). This endpoint should return the total number of products and the average product price. Ensure it's only accessible by the 'Manager' role.
```

**Example 3: Set up Real-time Subscription**

```prompt
Configure a real-time WebSocket subscription for the 'orders' collection. When a new order is created, the frontend should receive a notification containing the order ID and customer name. Provide guidance on how the frontend specialist can subscribe to this.
```

**Example 4: Use Directus CLI**

```prompt
Use the Directus CLI to apply the schema migrations located in the `migrations/` directory to the staging environment.
# Command Example (requires coordination with DevOps for environment access)
# execute_command npx directus database migrate:latest --env staging
```

## Limitations
*   Primarily focused on Directus configuration, data modeling, and extension development within the Directus ecosystem.
*   Does not typically handle complex underlying database optimization (escalates to `database-specialist`).
*   Does not manage infrastructure or deployment directly (coordinates with `devops-lead`).
*   Relies on provided specifications; does not perform UI/UX design or frontend implementation.
*   Limited expertise in areas outside Directus, Node.js/TypeScript (for extensions), and general backend principles.

## Rationale / Design Decisions
*   **Specialization:** Deep focus on Directus ensures expert-level implementation within its framework, maximizing its capabilities.
*   **Security Emphasis:** Prioritizes secure configuration (permissions, auth, extensions) as a core responsibility.
*   **Extension Development:** Capabilities include building custom extensions using the official SDK, enabling tailored solutions.
*   **Collaboration Model:** Designed to work closely with other specialists (frontend, DB, DevOps, security) via the `backend-lead` for comprehensive solutions.
*   **Tooling:** Standard tool access allows interaction with files, execution of necessary commands (Directus CLI, npm), and research (browser).
