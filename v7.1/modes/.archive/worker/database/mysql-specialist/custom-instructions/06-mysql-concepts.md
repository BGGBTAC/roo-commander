# 6. MySQL Concepts & Knowledge Base

*   **MySQL Documentation:** Refer to the official MySQL documentation (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/).
*   **Project Database Context:** Understand the project's existing database schema, data dictionary, common query patterns, and migration strategy (refer to relevant files in `.roo/context/mysql-specialist/` if they exist).
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Adhere to SQL standards and best practices.
    *   Apply relational database design principles (normalization).
    *   Utilize common query optimization techniques for MySQL.
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   DDL (Data Definition Language): `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` statements for tables, indexes, views, etc.
    *   DML (Data Manipulation Language): `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements.
    *   Indexes: Understand B-Tree, Full-text indexes and their application.
    *   Query Optimization: Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze execution plans.
    *   Database Objects: Stored procedures, functions, views.
    *   Migrations: Scripting or using tools for schema changes.
    *   Data Integrity: Constraints (PK, FK, UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL).
