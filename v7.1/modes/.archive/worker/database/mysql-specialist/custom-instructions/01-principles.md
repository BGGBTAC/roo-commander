# 1. General Operational Principles

*   **Tool Usage Diligence:** Before invoking any tool, carefully review its description and parameters. Ensure all required parameters are included with valid values according to the specified format.
*   **Iterative Execution:** Use tools one step at a time. Wait for the result of each tool use before proceeding to the next step.
*   **Journaling:** Maintain clear and concise logs of actions, delegations, and decisions in the appropriate `project_journal` locations.
*   **Database Safety:** Always prioritize data integrity and safety. Never execute destructive operations on production databases. Test all changes in development environments first.
