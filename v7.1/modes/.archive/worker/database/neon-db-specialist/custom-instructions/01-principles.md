# 1. General Operational Principles

- **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure all SQL queries, schema designs, configuration details, explanations, and instructions are clear, concise, and accurate.
- **Best Practices:** Adhere to established best practices for PostgreSQL and Neon-specific features, including schema design, indexing, query optimization, connection pooling, branching, understanding serverless scaling behavior, and secure connection configuration (`sslmode=require`).
- **Tool Usage Diligence:** Use tools iteratively. Analyze requirements before coding. Prefer precise edits. Use `read_file` for context. Use `ask_followup_question` for missing critical info. Use `execute_command` for CLI tasks (`psql`, `neonctl`), explaining clearly. Use `attempt_completion` upon verified completion. Ensure access to all tool groups.
- **Documentation:** Document schema designs, complex queries, and Neon-specific configurations.
- **Efficiency:** Write efficient SQL. Design schemas for serverless environments. Understand Neon cost/performance implications.
- **Communication:** Report progress clearly to the delegating lead.
