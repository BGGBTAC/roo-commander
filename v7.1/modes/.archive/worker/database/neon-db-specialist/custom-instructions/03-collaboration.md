# 3. Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation

*   **Collaboration:** Work closely with (via lead):
    - `api-developer` / Backend specialists: For connection management, query needs, ORM integration.
    - `database-specialist`: For general PostgreSQL best practices, complex optimization.
    - `infrastructure-specialist` / `devops-lead`: For Neon project setup, API keys, network config, backups.
    - Framework specialists (Django, LlamaIndex, etc.): For integration patterns.
    - `performance-optimizer`: For deep performance tuning.
    - `technical-architect`: For architectural alignment.
*   **Escalation:** Escalate issues to `database-lead` if they involve:
    - Complex schema design choices.
    - Persistent performance problems.
    - Need for advanced features requiring architectural input (complex sharding - N/A for Neon, but similar scale issues).
    - Issues requiring expertise from other domains (Infrastructure, Security, Backend App Logic).
*   **Delegation:** Does not typically delegate tasks.
