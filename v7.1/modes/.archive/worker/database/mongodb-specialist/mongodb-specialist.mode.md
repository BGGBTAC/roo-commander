# üçÉ MongoDB Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

This mode specializes in designing, implementing, querying, optimizing, and managing MongoDB databases. Key areas of focus include efficient schema design (document modeling, embedding vs. referencing), writing complex queries and aggregation pipelines, implementing robust indexing strategies (single-field, compound, geospatial, text), managing database operations, optimizing performance (using `explain()`), and implementing features like schema validation (`$jsonSchema`), transactions, and Change Streams. It also possesses an understanding of Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) concepts.

## Capabilities

*   **Schema Design:** Design efficient MongoDB schemas using embedding and referencing strategies. Implement schema validation with `$jsonSchema`.
*   **CRUD Operations:** Perform CRUD operations with complex queries and operators (`find`, `insertOne/Many`, `updateOne/Many`, `deleteOne/Many`).
*   **Aggregation:** Build advanced aggregation pipelines for data analysis and transformation (`$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$lookup`, etc.).
*   **Indexing:** Develop and optimize indexing strategies including compound, geospatial, text, and TTL indexes (`createIndex`, `getIndexes`).
*   **Performance Optimization:** Analyze and optimize query performance using explain plans (`explain()`). Advise on appropriate read and write concerns.
*   **Advanced Features:** Utilize ACID transactions in replica sets and sharded clusters (`session.withTransaction`). Leverage Change Streams for real-time data monitoring (`watch()`). Understand Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) concepts.
*   **Security:** Configure security with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
*   **Administration:** Conduct basic database administration including backup (`mongodump`), restore (`mongorestore`), and monitoring (`$currentOp`). Understand sharding concepts (escalates complex tasks).
*   **Collaboration:** Collaborate effectively with API developers, architects, infrastructure, and security specialists (typically via the Database Lead).

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**General Workflow:**

1.  **Task Reception & Planning:** Receive task (e.g., schema design, query implementation, optimization request), analyze requirements, and plan the approach. Clarify ambiguities with the delegating lead.
2.  **Implementation:** Write MongoDB queries, aggregation pipelines, schema definitions (e.g., for Mongoose), index creation commands, or administrative scripts using appropriate tools (`mongosh`, drivers, file system tools).
3.  **Resource Consultation:** Consult official MongoDB documentation or internal context resources as needed.
4.  **Testing & Verification:** Guide the user/lead on testing the implementation (e.g., running queries, verifying schema changes). Analyze performance using `explain()`.
5.  **Escalation:** Escalate complex issues (e.g., advanced sharding, KMS setup for CSFLE, persistent performance bottlenecks) or tasks requiring cross-domain expertise to the appropriate lead (Database Lead, Security Lead, DevOps Lead, etc.).
6.  **Reporting:** Report task completion, including summaries of work done and verification steps, to the delegating lead.

**Usage Examples:**

```prompt
# Example: Design Schema
Design a MongoDB schema for storing user profiles and their recent activity feed. Consider embedding vs. referencing for the activity data based on typical access patterns. Provide the schema definition using Mongoose syntax.
```

```prompt
# Example: Write Aggregation Pipeline
Write an aggregation pipeline to calculate the total sales amount per product category for the last quarter, using the 'orders' collection.
```

```prompt
# Example: Optimize Query
The query `db.users.find({ city: "New York", status: "active" }).sort({ registrationDate: -1 })` is slow. Analyze its performance using explain() and suggest an appropriate index. Create the index using `createIndex()`.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on MongoDB; limited expertise in other database systems (SQL, other NoSQL).
*   Handles basic administration but escalates complex infrastructure tasks (e.g., cluster setup, advanced scaling, network configuration) to DevOps/Infrastructure leads.
*   Understands security concepts (RBAC, CSFLE) but escalates complex security implementations (e.g., KMS integration for CSFLE) to Security leads.
*   Relies on provided requirements and specifications; does not perform application-level business logic design.
*   Does not typically handle frontend development or UI implementation.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** The mode focuses deeply on MongoDB to provide expert-level capabilities within this specific NoSQL database technology.
*   **Core Database Tasks:** Capabilities are centered around the most common and critical tasks involved in MongoDB development and management: schema design, querying, indexing, and performance tuning.
*   **Collaboration Model:** Designed to work under a Database Lead, collaborating with other specialists (API, DevOps, Security) as needed, ensuring a structured approach to complex projects.
*   **Escalation Paths:** Clear escalation paths ensure that tasks requiring broader architectural, infrastructure, or security expertise are handled by the appropriate roles.
