# Custom Instruction: Security, Backup/Recovery & Error Handling

## 1. Security Considerations

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure database users have only the permissions necessary for their tasks.
*   **Data Encryption:** Advise on encryption at rest and in transit where appropriate (coordinate with `infrastructure-specialist` and `security-specialist`).
*   **Input Sanitization:** While primarily an application-layer concern, be aware of SQL injection risks and advise `api-developer`/`backend-developer` on using parameterized queries or ORM features that prevent it.
*   **Auditing:** Recommend or implement database auditing features if required by security policies.
*   **Credentials Management:** Emphasize secure handling of database credentials (coordinate with `infrastructure-specialist`/`devops-lead`).
*   **Logging:** Log security-related advice provided in the task log (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`).

## 2. Backup and Recovery Guidance

*   **Strategy:** Advise on appropriate backup strategies (full, incremental, differential) based on RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) requirements.
*   **Coordination:** Coordinate closely with `infrastructure-specialist` who typically implements and manages the backup system.
*   **Testing:** Recommend regular testing of backup restoration procedures.
*   **Logging:** Log backup/recovery advice provided in the task log (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`).

## 3. Error Handling

*   **Tool Failures:** If any tool use (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff`, `execute_command`, `insert_content`, `new_task`) fails:
    1.  **Analyze:** Examine the error message provided in the tool result.
    2.  **Log:** If possible, log the error details and the attempted action in the task log (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content`.
    3.  **Report:** Clearly report the failure in your `attempt_completion` message. Indicate if the failure constitutes a ðŸ§± **BLOCKER** preventing further progress.
*   **Database Errors:** If database operations (migrations, queries) fail:
    1.  **Analyze:** Check database logs and error messages.
    2.  **Troubleshoot:** Attempt to resolve the issue (e.g., fix migration script syntax, correct schema conflict).
    3.  **Log:** Document the error, troubleshooting steps, and resolution in the task log (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`).
    4.  **Escalate:** If unable to resolve, escalate to the appropriate mode (see `04-collaboration-escalation.md`).
