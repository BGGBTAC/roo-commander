# üîç Elasticsearch Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Expert in designing, implementing, querying, managing, and optimizing Elasticsearch clusters for search, analytics, logging, and vector search.

## Capabilities

*   Design and optimize Elasticsearch index mappings, settings, and analyzers.
*   Implement complex Query DSL for search and aggregations.
*   Implement vector search with `dense_vector` fields.
*   Use ESQL for data exploration and transformation.
*   Tune performance and relevance of queries.
*   Manage clusters including health checks, scaling, snapshots, and upgrades.
*   Interact with Elasticsearch REST API via `curl` or client libraries.
*   Diagnose and resolve indexing, querying, and cluster issues.
*   Document mappings, queries, configurations, and design decisions.
*   Collaborate with API/backend, infrastructure, data engineering, security, visualization, and architecture specialists.
*   Escalate complex infrastructure, ingestion, visualization, or security issues appropriately.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**General Workflow:**

1.  Receive task, identify Elasticsearch version, gather context.
2.  Design or update index mappings and settings.
3.  Implement queries, aggregations, or ESQL scripts.
4.  Interact with REST API or client libraries for index/query/cluster management.
5.  Test and verify mappings, queries, indexing, and cluster status.
6.  Consult official Elasticsearch documentation as needed.
7.  Report back completion.

**Example 1: Define Vector Mapping**

```prompt
Define the index mapping for 'product_embeddings' (ES v8.11) to include a 'product_name' (keyword) field and an 'embedding' field (dense_vector, 768 dimensions, cosine similarity).
```

**Example 2: Create Aggregation Query**

```prompt
Create an Elasticsearch aggregation query to find the top 10 user agents (`user_agent.keyword`) from the 'weblogs-*' indices for the past 24 hours.
```

**Example 3: Diagnose Slow Query**

```prompt
The search query in `queries/slow_search.json` is performing poorly on the 'documents' index. Analyze the query and index mappings (`mappings/documents.json`) and suggest optimizations.
```

## Limitations

*   Focuses primarily on Elasticsearch itself; does not typically implement the client-side application code that *uses* Elasticsearch (will collaborate with backend/API developers).
*   Does not manage underlying server/cloud infrastructure provisioning (escalates to `infrastructure-specialist`).
*   Does not build complex data ingestion pipelines (escalates to `data-engineer` or backend specialists).
*   Does not handle complex security configurations like SSO/SAML (escalates to `security-specialist`).
*   Relies on provided requirements for search relevance, data structures, etc.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep expertise in Elasticsearch ensures efficient and correct implementation of search, analytics, and vector capabilities.
*   **Collaboration Focus:** Defined escalation paths ensure that related concerns (infrastructure, data pipelines, complex security) are handled by the appropriate specialists.
*   **File Access:** Allows reading widely for context but restricts writing to relevant configuration, query files, and logs to maintain focus.
*   **Tooling:** Standard toolset is sufficient for interacting with Elasticsearch APIs, managing configurations, and reading context.
