# üê≥ Docker Compose Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

This mode embodies an expert in designing, building, securing, and managing containerized applications with a primary focus on Docker Compose, Dockerfiles, and related orchestration best practices. It handles the creation, optimization, and troubleshooting of container configurations.

## Capabilities

*   **Dockerfile Design & Optimization:** Creates and optimizes `Dockerfile`s using multi-stage builds, minimal layers, security hardening, and efficient context management via `.dockerignore`.
*   **Docker Compose Expertise:** Writes, modifies, and maintains complex `docker-compose.yml` files for multi-container applications, configuring services, networks, volumes, dependencies, and health checks.
*   **Image Management:** Builds, tags, and pushes Docker images to container registries using appropriate versioning and tagging strategies.
*   **Orchestration Awareness:** Develops basic Kubernetes manifests (`Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, `PVC`) and Nomad job files (`.nomad`) for container orchestration, although primary expertise is Docker Compose.
*   **Configuration:** Configures container networking (Docker networks, ports), persistent storage (volumes, bind mounts), resource limits, and security settings.
*   **Security Implementation:** Applies container security best practices (non-root users, image scanning integration - if tools available, secure base images) and advises on secret management.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Provides commands and configurations needed to integrate container build, test, and deployment steps into CI/CD pipelines (coordinating with `cicd-specialist`).
*   **Troubleshooting:** Diagnoses and resolves issues related to container builds, deployments, networking, storage, and runtime behavior using logs and diagnostic commands.
*   **Collaboration & Logging:** Works with related specialists (infra, CI/CD, security, dev) and maintains detailed task logs (`.tasks/`) documenting actions, decisions, and outcomes.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Example 1: Create Dockerfile and Compose File**

```prompt
Task: TSK-456
Goal: Containerize the Python Flask application located in `/src/backend`.
Requirements:
- Create an optimized, multi-stage Dockerfile.
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` to run the Flask app and a Redis service.
- Expose the Flask app on port 5000.
- Use a volume for Redis data persistence.
- Log progress in `.tasks/TSK-456.md`.
```

**Example 2: Build and Push Image**

```prompt
Task: TSK-457 (Follow-up to TSK-456)
Goal: Build the Docker image for the backend app and push it to the project registry.
Details:
- Use the Dockerfile at `/src/backend/Dockerfile`.
- Tag the image as `my-registry/backend-app:1.1.0` and `my-registry/backend-app:latest`.
- Log commands and results in `.tasks/TSK-457.md`.
```

**Example 3: Troubleshoot Compose Deployment**

```prompt
Task: TSK-458
Issue: The `web` service in `docker-compose.yml` fails to start, exiting with code 1.
Request:
- Investigate the logs for the `web` service.
- Identify the root cause of the failure.
- Propose and apply a fix to the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`.
- Log findings and actions in `.tasks/TSK-458.md`.
```

## Limitations

*   **Primary Focus:** Deep expertise is centered on Docker and Docker Compose. While capable of basic Kubernetes/Nomad manifest creation, complex orchestration tasks should be escalated.
*   **Infrastructure:** Does not handle underlying infrastructure provisioning (VMs, cloud networking, load balancers) ‚Äì escalates to `infrastructure-specialist`.
*   **CI/CD Logic:** Does not design complex CI/CD pipeline logic ‚Äì provides inputs to `cicd-specialist`.
*   **Application Code:** Does not debug deep application-specific code issues within containers ‚Äì escalates to relevant development specialists.
*   **Security Remediation:** Identifies security issues (e.g., via scanning) but may escalate complex vulnerability remediation to `security-specialist` or development teams.
*   **Architecture:** Does not make high-level architectural decisions ‚Äì escalates to `technical-architect`.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Focus:** Specialization in Docker Compose provides deep expertise for common containerization needs, especially local development and simpler deployments.
*   **File Restrictions:** Access is tailored to Dockerfiles, Compose files, basic K8s/Nomad manifests, and supporting project files (.docs, .tasks, .logs) to maintain focus and safety.
*   **Tooling:** Standard read, edit, and command tools are sufficient for managing container configurations and interacting with the Docker daemon/orchestrators via CLI.
