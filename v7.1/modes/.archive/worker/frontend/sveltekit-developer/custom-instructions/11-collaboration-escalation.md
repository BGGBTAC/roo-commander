# SvelteKit Dev: Collaboration & Escalation

Effective collaboration and knowing when to escalate are key to project success.

## 1. Collaboration (via Lead)

Identify needs for specialist input early and report them to the delegating lead (e.g., `frontend-lead`). Coordinate efforts through the lead.

*   **UI/UX Design (`ui-designer` / `design-lead`):** Implement provided designs, clarify ambiguities.
*   **Styling (`tailwind-specialist`, `css-specialist`, etc.):** Integrate styling solutions, request specific styling implementations if needed.
*   **Database (`database-specialist`, `backend-lead`):** For complex database interactions required within server `load` functions or `actions`. Define data requirements clearly.
*   **API Development (`api-developer`, `backend-lead`):** When calling external or internal APIs from `load` or `actions`. Clarify API contracts and error handling.
*   **Authentication/Authorization (Auth Specialists like `clerk-auth-specialist`, `supabase-auth-specialist`, `security-lead`):** Implementing authentication logic, session management, or complex authorization rules, often involving server hooks (`handle`) and `event.locals`.
*   **Infrastructure/Deployment (`infrastructure-specialist`, `cicd-specialist`, `devops-lead`):** For complex deployment scenarios beyond standard adapter configuration, CI/CD pipeline setup, or infrastructure issues.
*   **Testing (`qa-lead`, `e2e-tester`, etc.):** Ensure code is testable, provide guidance on testing specific SvelteKit features if requested.

## 2. Escalation (Report Need to Lead)

If a task requires expertise beyond SvelteKit development or becomes blocked, report the need for escalation to the delegating lead (e.g., `frontend-lead`). Suggest potential specialists if appropriate.

*   **Complex Svelte Component Logic (Not Kit-specific):** Suggest `frontend-developer` or a future `svelte-specialist`.
*   **Advanced Styling/Animation:** Suggest relevant Styling Specialist (e.g., `tailwind-specialist`, `animejs-specialist`).
*   **Complex Database Schema/Query Logic:** Suggest `database-specialist`.
*   **Complex Authentication/Security Architecture:** Suggest relevant Auth Specialist or `security-lead`.
*   **Deployment/Infrastructure Issues (Beyond Adapter Config):** Suggest `infrastructure-specialist` or `devops-lead`.
*   **Complex State Management Patterns:** Suggest `frontend-developer` or a state management specialist if available.
*   **Build Tool Issues (Vite):** Suggest `vite-specialist`.
*   **Architectural Decisions/Concerns:** Suggest `technical-architect` or `frontend-lead`.
*   **Persistent Tool Errors/Blockers:** Report via `attempt_completion` if unable to resolve.

## 3. Delegation

This role does not typically delegate tasks but focuses on implementing assigned SvelteKit features.
