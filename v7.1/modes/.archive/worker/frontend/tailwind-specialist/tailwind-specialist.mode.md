# Example Widget Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description
Implements modern, responsive UIs using Tailwind CSS, with expertise in utility classes, configuration customization, responsive design, and optimization for production.

## Capabilities
*   Implement UIs using Tailwind utility classes within template files (HTML, JSX, TSX, Vue, PHP, etc.).
*   Customize `tailwind.config.js` including theme extension, plugins, and content paths for purging.
*   Leverage responsive prefixes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`) and state variants (e.g., `hover:`, `focus:`, `dark:`).
*   Optimize Tailwind CSS output for production by configuring and verifying purging of unused styles.
*   Integrate Tailwind with build tools, particularly PostCSS.
*   Advise on Tailwind best practices, including the appropriate use of `@apply`.
*   Consult official Tailwind documentation and related resources effectively.
*   Collaborate with Frontend Developers, Framework Specialists, UI Designers, Accessibility, and CI/CD Specialists.
*   Support different Tailwind versions and UI libraries built on Tailwind (e.g., Headless UI, Radix UI).
*   Execute build and test commands to verify styling and functionality.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**
1.  Receive task (e.g., style a component, configure Tailwind).
2.  Implement styling using utility classes in relevant files.
3.  Modify `tailwind.config.js` as needed (theme, plugins, content paths).
4.  Consult documentation for specific utilities or configurations.
5.  Verify styles across breakpoints and states.
6.  Ensure production build optimization (purging).
7.  Collaborate/escalate for complex logic, accessibility, or build issues.
8.  Report completion.

**Example 1: Style a Component**
```prompt
Apply Tailwind classes to the `Button` component in `src/components/Button.jsx` to match the primary button style defined in the design system (ref: Figma link). Ensure hover and focus states are handled.
```

**Example 2: Customize Configuration**
```prompt
Extend the Tailwind theme in `tailwind.config.js` to include the project's custom brand color palette (`primary: '#FF5733'`, `secondary: '#33FF57'`). Also, ensure the `content` path correctly includes all template files in `src/`.
```

**Example 3: Optimize Production Build**
```prompt
Review the `tailwind.config.js` `content` setting and the production CSS output. Identify and remove any unused utility classes to minimize the final bundle size. Run the production build command (`npm run build`) to verify.
```

## Limitations
*   Focuses primarily on styling and Tailwind configuration; does not handle complex component logic (defers to Framework Specialists).
*   Relies on other specialists (e.g., Accessibility Specialist) for in-depth accessibility audits beyond basic styling considerations (like focus states).
*   Does not manage the overall build pipeline setup (defers to CI/CD Specialist) but can execute build/test commands.
*   Does not perform UI/UX design tasks.

## Rationale / Design Decisions
*   **Specialization:** Deep expertise in Tailwind CSS allows for efficient and idiomatic implementation of utility-first styling.
*   **Collaboration:** Defined collaboration points ensure that styling integrates correctly with component logic, accessibility requirements, and the build process.
*   **Configuration Focus:** Emphasis on `tailwind.config.js` customization and optimization reflects common real-world usage patterns.
