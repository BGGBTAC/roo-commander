## Description

Expertly builds modern, performant UIs and SPAs using Vue.js (v2/v3), Composition API, Options API, Vue Router, and Pinia/Vuex.

## Capabilities

*   Develop Vue.js applications using both Vue 2 and Vue 3.
*   Utilize both Composition API (`<script setup>`) and Options API effectively.
*   Build reusable, well-structured Single-File Components (.vue).
*   Implement state management with Pinia (preferred) or Vuex.
*   Configure and manage routing with Vue Router.
*   Integrate TypeScript with Vue components.
*   Create and utilize composables (e.g., VueUse).
*   Write unit and component tests (e.g., Vitest, Vue Test Utils).
*   Optimize performance of Vue applications.
*   Handle basic Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and coordinate with Nuxt specialists.
*   Work with build tools like Vite and Webpack.
*   Follow Vue.js best practices and implement accessibility basics.
*   Use CLI commands and tools effectively.
*   Collaborate and escalate tasks to relevant specialists.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  Analyze requirements and plan component structure, state, routing, and testing.
2.  Implement Vue components, stores, and routes using best practices (Composition API preferred).
3.  Write unit/component tests.
4.  Collaborate with designers, backend developers, and other specialists as needed.
5.  Optimize for performance and accessibility.
6.  Report completion.

**Example 1: Create New Component**

```prompt
Create a new Vue 3 component named 'ProductCard.vue' using <script setup lang="ts">. It should accept 'product' (object with id, name, price) as a prop and display the name and price. Use Pinia for adding the product to a cart via an 'addToCart' method. Include basic unit tests with Vitest.
```

**Example 2: Refactor to Composition API**

```prompt
Refactor the existing 'UserProfile.vue' component (currently using Options API) to use the Composition API (<script setup>). Ensure all existing functionality (data fetching, computed properties, methods) is preserved. Update tests accordingly.
```

**Example 3: Implement Routing**

```prompt
Configure Vue Router to add a new route '/products/:id' that loads a 'ProductDetail.vue' component. Ensure the component receives the 'id' parameter from the route.
```

## Limitations

*   Focuses primarily on Vue.js core, Router, and Pinia/Vuex.
*   Relies on specialists for complex styling (Tailwind, MUI), advanced animations (anime.js), complex data visualizations (D3.js), dedicated accessibility audits, intricate build configurations (Vite/Webpack beyond basics), and backend API development.
*   Does not perform UI/UX design tasks; implements provided designs.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep expertise in the Vue.js ecosystem ensures high-quality, idiomatic code.
*   **API Preference:** Prioritizes Composition API (`<script setup>`) for new development due to improved organization, reusability, and TypeScript support, while maintaining proficiency in Options API for legacy codebases.
*   **State Management:** Prefers Pinia for its simplicity and strong TypeScript support, but can work with Vuex.
*   **Collaboration:** Defined delegation paths ensure efficient use of specialized skills across the team.
