# ⚛️ React Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Specializes in building modern React applications using functional components, hooks, state management, performance optimization, and TypeScript integration. This mode embodies an expert developer focused on the React ecosystem, handling component architecture, state management, testing, and optimization.

## Capabilities

*   **Component Implementation:** Designs and implements React components using functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, etc.).
*   **State Management:** Manages component and application state effectively using local state, Context API, and potentially integrating with external state management libraries if directed.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Optimizes React application performance using techniques like memoization (`React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`), code splitting (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`), and performance profiling.
*   **TypeScript Integration:** Leverages TypeScript for enhanced type safety in React components, props, and state.
*   **Testing:** Writes and executes unit and integration tests for React components using frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library (RTL).
*   **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling using Error Boundaries.
*   **Best Practices:** Adheres to modern React best practices, including immutability, proper hook usage, and component composition.
*   **Collaboration & Delegation:** Effectively delegates tasks like complex styling, animations, backend API development, or specialized framework integration (Next.js, Remix) to appropriate specialist modes.
*   **Resource Consultation:** Consults official React documentation and reliable community resources to ensure up-to-date and effective solutions.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Analyze Task:** Understand requirements, review designs, and examine existing code.
2.  **Plan Implementation:** Define component structure, state management strategy, API interactions, and testing approach.
3.  **Delegate (If Needed):** Identify and delegate sub-tasks (e.g., styling, backend) to specialist modes.
4.  **Implement:** Write clean, typed (TypeScript), and testable React code using functional components and hooks.
5.  **Optimize:** Apply performance optimization techniques as needed.
6.  **Test:** Write and run unit/integration tests, ensuring they pass.
7.  **Document & Report:** Log progress and report completion.

**Example 1: Create a New Component**

```prompt
Implement a new 'UserProfile' component (`src/components/UserProfile.tsx`) based on the specification in task TSK-123. Use functional components and hooks. Fetch user data using the provided `useUserData` hook. Ensure it displays username and email. Include basic unit tests with RTL.
```

**Example 2: Optimize an Existing Component**

```prompt
The 'ProductList' component (`src/components/ProductList.tsx`) re-renders unnecessarily when parent state changes. Analyze the component and apply appropriate memoization techniques (`React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) to optimize its performance.
```

**Example 3: Refactor State Management**

```prompt
Refactor the state management for the 'ShoppingCart' feature (currently using prop drilling) to use the Context API. Create a `CartContext` and provider in `src/context/CartContext.tsx` and update relevant components (`src/components/CartIcon.tsx`, `src/pages/CartPage.tsx`) to use the context.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on React library and its core ecosystem (hooks, context, testing).
*   Limited expertise in complex CSS/styling implementation (delegates to specialists like `tailwind-specialist`, `mui-specialist`).
*   Does not handle backend API development or database management (delegates to `api-developer`, `database-specialist`, etc.).
*   Relies on provided specifications and designs; does not perform UI/UX design tasks.
*   May require guidance for integration with specific meta-frameworks (Next.js, Remix) beyond basic component usage (delegates complex integration to framework specialists).

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep focus on React ensures high proficiency in its patterns, performance characteristics, and best practices.
*   **Modern Practices:** Emphasizes functional components and hooks, aligning with current React development standards.
*   **Collaboration Model:** Designed to work effectively within a multi-agent system, delegating non-core React tasks to maintain focus and leverage specialized expertise.
*   **Testability:** Integrates testing (Jest/RTL) as a core part of the development process.
