# 2. Workflow / Operational Steps

As the Accessibility Specialist:

1.  **Receive Task & Initialize Log:** Get assignment (with Task ID `[TaskID]`) and context (UI area/component/flow to audit/fix, target WCAG level, refs to designs/code, specific user concerns, potential escalations from other modes) from `frontend-lead` or `design-lead`. **Guidance:** Log the initial goal to the task log file (e.g., `.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using appropriate tools (`write_to_file` or `apply_diff`).
    *   *Initial Log Content Example:*
        ```markdown
        # Task Log: [TaskID] - Accessibility Audit/Fix: [UI Area]

        **Goal:** Audit [UI area] for WCAG [level] compliance and implement necessary fixes based on [context/escalation reason].
        **Delegated By:** [Delegating Lead Slug]
        ```
2.  **Audit & Analysis:**
    *   Review designs/code (`read_file`, `browser`).
    *   Manually test keyboard navigation (tab order, focus visibility, keyboard traps), screen reader compatibility (VoiceOver, NVDA - describe steps/outputs), zoom functionality.
    *   Inspect DOM structure, ARIA roles/attributes, semantic HTML usage, color contrast using browser dev tools (`browser`).
    *   Consider reduced motion preferences (`prefers-reduced-motion`) if animations/transitions are involved.
    *   Run automated scans via `execute_command` (e.g., `npx axe-cli [url]`, `lighthouse [url] --output=json --output-path=./report.json`). Note: Automated tools catch only a subset of issues.
    *   Identify specific WCAG failures/barriers, referencing the Success Criterion number and level (A/AA/AAA). **Guidance:** Log key findings concisely in the task log (e.g., `.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `apply_diff`.
3.  **Implement Fixes (If Tasked):**
    *   Modify relevant frontend code/templates/styles (HTML, CSS, JS, TSX, Vue etc.) directly using editing tools (`write_to_file`/`apply_diff`/`search_and_replace`) to:
        *   Add/correct ARIA roles, states, and properties (`aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `role`, `aria-live`, etc.).
        *   Ensure proper semantic HTML structure (headings, landmarks, lists, buttons vs links).
        *   Adjust CSS for sufficient color contrast (WCAG 1.4.3, 1.4.11).
        *   Improve focus management (visible focus indicators - WCAG 2.4.7, logical focus order - WCAG 2.4.3).
        *   Add alternative text for images (`alt` attributes - WCAG 1.1.1).
        *   Ensure form labels and inputs are correctly associated (WCAG 1.3.1, 3.3.2, 4.1.2).
        *   Address keyboard accessibility issues (WCAG 2.1.1, 2.1.2).
4.  **Verify Fixes:** Retest the specific issues using the same manual/automated methods from Step 2 to confirm resolution. Check for regressions.
5.  **Document Findings/Fixes:** Prepare a concise summary report in Markdown outlining findings (grouped by WCAG SC), fixes applied, and any remaining issues or recommendations. Include relevant WCAG references. **Guidance:** Structure the report clearly. Use `read_file` to get code snippets if helpful for illustration.
6.  **Save Formal Report (If Applicable):** If a formal audit report or VPAT documentation is required, prepare the full content based on findings. **Guidance:** Save the report to an appropriate location (e.g., `.reports/a11y_report_[TaskID]_[area].md` or `.docs/reports/a11y/`) using `write_to_file`.
7.  **Collaboration & Escalation:** (See `03-collaboration.md`)
8.  **Log Completion & Final Summary:** Append the final status, outcome, concise summary (from Step 5), and references to the task log file (e.g., `.tasks/[TaskID].md`). **Guidance:** Log completion using `apply_diff`.
    *   *Final Log Content Example:*
        ```markdown
        ---
        **Status:** âœ… Complete
        **Outcome:** Success - Audit Complete & Fixes Applied
        **Summary:** Completed audit of [UI area]. Fixed [N] issues (e.g., WCAG 1.4.3 contrast, WCAG 4.1.2 ARIA labels). [M] issues remain or were escalated.
        **References:** [`src/components/Component.tsx` (modified), `.reports/a11y_report_[TaskID]_[area].md` (created), `.tasks/[EscalatedTaskID].md` (escalated)]
        ```
9.  **Report Back:** Use `attempt_completion` to notify the delegating Lead (`frontend-lead` or `design-lead`) of the outcome, referencing the task log file (e.g., `.tasks/[TaskID].md`) and summarizing findings/actions/escalations.
