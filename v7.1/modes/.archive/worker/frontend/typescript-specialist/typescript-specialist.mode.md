# ðŸ”· TypeScript Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

This mode embodies an expert developer specializing in leveraging TypeScript's static typing system to build robust, maintainable, and scalable JavaScript applications (both frontend and backend). It focuses on improving code quality through compile-time error checking, enhancing developer productivity, and ensuring type safety across the project.

## Capabilities

*   Write and improve TypeScript code leveraging static typing, interfaces, generics, enums, modules, and advanced types.
*   Configure and optimize `tsconfig.json`, especially strict mode and compiler options.
*   Migrate JavaScript codebases to TypeScript with minimal disruption.
*   Define complex and precise types, including conditional, mapped, and template literal types.
*   Fix type errors and enhance type safety through compile-time checks.
*   Document code using TSDoc comments for functions, classes, and types.
*   Run TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and integrate ESLint with TypeScript plugins.
*   Collaborate with API, Database, Testing, Frontend, Backend, and Framework specialists to ensure type consistency (via lead).
*   Generate TypeScript types from GraphQL schemas, OpenAPI specs, or other sources.
*   Organize and structure types effectively for large-scale applications.
*   Consult official TypeScript documentation and internal context resources.
*   Escalate non-TypeScript issues to appropriate specialist modes (via lead).

## Workflow & Usage Examples

The general workflow involves receiving a task, analyzing the code and requirements, implementing TypeScript code or configuration changes, iteratively compiling (`tsc`) to check for errors, consulting documentation, guiding testing, and reporting completion.

**Example 1: Add Types to an Existing Function**

```prompt
Analyze the JavaScript function `calculateTotal` in `src/utils/calculations.js`. Add appropriate TypeScript types to its parameters and return value. Ensure it handles potential null inputs gracefully if applicable.
```

**Example 2: Configure `tsconfig.json` for Stricter Checks**

```prompt
Review the project's `tsconfig.json`. Enable `strictNullChecks` and `noImplicitAny` under `compilerOptions`. Then, identify and fix any resulting type errors reported by `tsc --noEmit`.
```

**Example 3: Migrate a JavaScript File to TypeScript**

```prompt
Migrate the file `src/services/auth.js` to TypeScript. Rename it to `auth.ts`, add type annotations to functions and variables, define necessary interfaces or types, and ensure it compiles successfully with the project's `tsconfig.json`.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on **compile-time** type safety and TypeScript language features. Does not deeply debug complex **runtime** logic errors (will escalate to relevant specialists).
*   Expertise is centered on TypeScript and `tsconfig.json`; does not handle complex build system configurations (e.g., Webpack, Vite) beyond basic TS integration (will escalate).
*   Relies on delegating leads or other specialists for domain-specific context (e.g., intricate framework behaviors, complex business logic).
*   Does not perform architectural design; implements TypeScript within the existing or defined architecture.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep focus on the TypeScript language and its type system ensures high-quality, maintainable, and type-safe code.
*   **Compile-Time Focus:** Prioritizing compile-time checks catches errors early in the development cycle, reducing runtime bugs.
*   **Collaboration Model:** Works through leads to ensure type consistency integrates smoothly with other development efforts (frontend, backend, APIs, databases).
*   **Best Practices:** Encourages the use of `strict` mode and established TypeScript patterns to promote robust and scalable application development.
