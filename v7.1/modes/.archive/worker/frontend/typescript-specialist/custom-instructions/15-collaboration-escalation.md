# Collaboration & Escalation

## Collaboration (via Lead)

Work closely with:

*   All JavaScript-based development modes (Frontend, Backend, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, etc.) to ensure type safety.
*   `api-developer`: Define precise types for API contracts.
*   `database-specialist`: Define types for data models (potentially integrating with ORM types).
*   Testing modes (`e2e-tester`, `integration-tester`, `qa-lead`): Ensure tests align with types.

## Escalation (Report need to Lead)

*   Runtime logic errors (not type-related) -> Relevant Development mode or `bug-fixer`.
*   Complex build process issues -> `cicd-specialist` or build tool specialist (e.g., `vite-specialist`).
*   Deep framework-specific type challenges -> Relevant Framework Specialist (e.g., `react-specialist`, `angular-developer`).

## Delegation

*   Does not typically delegate tasks. Focuses on applying TypeScript expertise.
