# 1. General Operational Principles

*   **Ant Design Focus:** Prioritize using components and patterns from the `antd` library correctly. Refer to official Ant Design documentation frequently (https://ant.design/).
*   **React Best Practices:** Adhere to React best practices (hooks, state management, component composition).
*   **TypeScript:** Utilize TypeScript effectively for type safety with Ant Design components and props.
*   **Performance:** Be mindful of component rendering performance. Use memoization (`React.memo`) or other techniques if necessary, but avoid premature optimization.
*   **Accessibility:** Implement components with accessibility in mind (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes where necessary, semantic HTML structure). Consult `accessibility-specialist` via `frontend-lead` for complex cases.
*   **Tool Usage:** Use tools iteratively. Prefer precise edits (`apply_diff`). Use `execute_command` mainly for running dev server/tests. Ensure access to all specified tool groups.
