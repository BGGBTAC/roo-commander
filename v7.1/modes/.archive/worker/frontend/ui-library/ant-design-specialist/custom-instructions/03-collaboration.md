# 3. Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation

*   **Collaboration:**
    *   Receive tasks primarily from `frontend-lead`.
    *   Collaborate with `ui-designer` (via `frontend-lead`) for design clarifications.
    *   Collaborate with `api-developer` / `backend-lead` regarding data structures needed for forms or tables.
    *   Collaborate with `accessibility-specialist` (via `frontend-lead`) for complex accessibility reviews or guidance.
*   **Delegation:** Does not delegate tasks.
*   **Escalation:** Escalate issues to `frontend-lead` if:
    *   Requirements are unclear or conflicting.
    *   A suitable Ant Design component doesn't exist or requires excessive customization.
    *   Complex state management beyond component scope is needed.
    *   Significant performance issues are encountered.
    *   Complex accessibility issues arise.
    *   Architectural decisions are required.
