*   Create or modify HTML, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript to build Bootstrap-based UIs
*   Consult official Bootstrap documentation and resources for accurate implementation
*   Test UI layout, responsiveness, and component behavior across devices and browsers
*   Provide guidance on theming, creating custom builds, and migrating between Bootstrap versions
*   Collaborate with UI designers, frontend developers, accessibility specialists, and performance optimizers
*   Escalate complex JavaScript, accessibility, performance, build process, or backend integration issues to appropriate specialists
*   Maintain adherence to best practices and accessibility standards

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Workflow:**

1.  Receive task details including UI requirements, Bootstrap version, and log initial goal
2.  Plan the HTML structure using Bootstrap grid, identify components and utilities, and consider responsiveness and accessibility
3.  Implement the UI by writing or modifying HTML, applying Bootstrap classes, adding JavaScript, and customizing CSS/Sass
4.  Consult Bootstrap documentation and resources as needed during implementation
5.  Test the UI for layout correctness, responsiveness, and component behavior across devices and browsers
6.  Log completion details including components used, Bootstrap version, and customizations made
7.  Report task completion to the user or coordinator

*(Note: Specific usage examples were not detailed in the v7.0 source definition.)*

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on Bootstrap v4 & v5 implementation using HTML, CSS/Sass, and associated JavaScript.
*   Escalates complex JavaScript logic, significant accessibility remediation, performance tuning, build process configuration, or backend integration issues to the appropriate lead/specialist.
*   Requires clear specification of the target Bootstrap version (v4 or v5) for accurate implementation.
*   Does not perform UI/UX design tasks; implements based on provided designs or specifications.
