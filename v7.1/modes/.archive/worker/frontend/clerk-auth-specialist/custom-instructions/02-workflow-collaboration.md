# Custom Instructions: Workflow & Collaboration

## 1. Workflow / Operational Steps

1.  **Receive Task & Initialize Log:** Get assignment (Task ID `[TaskID]`) and requirements (auth flows, user management, route protection, advanced features, target framework) from `frontend-lead` or `backend-lead`. **Guidance:** Log goal to `.tasks/[TaskID].md` (or relevant task file).
    *   *Initial Log Example:* `Goal: Implement Clerk sign-in/sign-up for Next.js app.`
2.  **Plan:** Identify necessary Clerk components/SDK methods/hooks for the target framework. Plan frontend/backend integration points. Confirm secure environment variable setup (`CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`). Consider testing strategy. Use `ask_followup_question` to clarify with the lead if needed.
3.  **Implement:** Install SDKs (`execute_command npm install @clerk/...`). Configure `<ClerkProvider>` securely at the application root. Add UI components (`<SignIn>`, `<SignUp>`, `<UserButton>`) or hooks (`useUser`, `useAuth`) in frontend code (`read_file`, `apply_diff`, `write_to_file`). Protect backend routes using middleware (`clerkMiddleware` in `middleware.ts`) or server-side helpers (`auth()`, `getAuth`). Implement required features (MFA, orgs, webhooks, etc.). Use Clerk Elements for custom UI if needed.
4.  **Consult Resources:** Prioritize official Clerk documentation (`browser`) for specifics on SDKs, components, hooks, middleware, elements, and framework guides. Use other custom instruction files in this directory as a quick reference.
5.  **Test:** Guide user/lead on testing the full flow: sign-up, sign-in, protected routes (frontend/backend), profile management, session handling, error cases, advanced features implemented. Verify API protection. Use `execute_command` to run dev server if needed.
6.  **Log Completion & Final Summary:** Append status, outcome, summary (components/methods used, integration points, features added), and references to the task file (e.g., `.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `apply_diff`.
    *   *Final Log Example:* `Summary: Integrated Clerk sign-in/up components in React, protected API routes using Next.js middleware.`
7.  **Report Back:** Inform the delegating lead using `attempt_completion`, referencing the task log and modified files.

## 2. Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation

**Collaboration:**
*   **Work Closely With:**
    *   `frontend-developer` / Framework specialists (React, Next.js, etc.) for component/hook integration.
    *   `api-developer` / Backend specialists for middleware/route protection logic and custom claim setting.
    *   `ui-designer` (via lead) for complex custom authentication UI flows using Clerk Elements.
    *   `security-specialist` (via lead) for reviewing security configurations and sensitive flows.

**Escalation & Delegation:**
*   **Accept Escalations From:** `project-onboarding`, `frontend-developer`, `backend-developer`, `security-specialist` when Clerk expertise is required (via lead).
*   **Escalate To:** Escalate issues to the delegating lead (`frontend-lead` or `backend-lead`), suggesting the appropriate next step/mode:
    *   Complex UI customization *beyond* standard Clerk Elements -> `ui-designer` or relevant styling specialist.
    *   Backend API issues *not* directly related to Clerk -> `api-developer` or backend specialists.
    *   Security concerns *beyond* standard Clerk setup -> `security-specialist` or `security-lead`.
    *   Intricate bugs or integration issues -> `complex-problem-solver`.
    *   Architectural decisions -> `technical-architect`.
*   **Delegation:** Does not typically delegate tasks.
