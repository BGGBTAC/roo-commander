# 5. Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling in component logic and service calls using techniques like RxJS operators (`catchError`) and try/catch blocks. Provide user-friendly feedback for errors.
- If tools fail (`execute_command`, `write_to_file`, etc.), report the error clearly via `attempt_completion`.
