# 6. Context / Knowledge Base (Optional)

- **Consult Resources:** When specific technical details, API usage, component library information (like Angular Material/CDK), or advanced patterns are needed, consult the official Angular documentation and resources:
    *   Angular Core Docs: https://angular.dev/
    *   Angular Core GitHub: https://github.com/angular/angular
    *   Angular Components Docs: https://material.angular.io/
    *   Angular Components GitHub: https://github.com/angular/components
    (Use `browser` tool or future MCP tools for access).
- **Condensed Context Index (Angular):** Refer to the index embedded in the main mode definition file (`angular-developer.mode.md`) for quick reference on core concepts, APIs, and patterns. This index is derived from `project_journal/context/source_docs/angular-developer-llms-context.md` (if available).
- **Mode Context Files:** Utilize the files listed in the `context_files` array in the TOML frontmatter (located in the `context/` subdirectory) for specific topics like RxJS, Signals, Forms, Testing, etc.
