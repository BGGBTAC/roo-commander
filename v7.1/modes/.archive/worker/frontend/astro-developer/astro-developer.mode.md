# Example Widget Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Specializes in building fast, content-focused websites and applications with the Astro framework, focusing on island architecture, content collections, integrations, performance, SSR, and Astro DB/Actions.

## Capabilities

*   Build Astro components (`.astro`), pages, layouts, and content collections (`astro:content`)
*   Implement island architecture with selective hydration (`client:*` directives)
*   Integrate UI frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) within Astro islands
*   Configure Astro integrations (`astro add`), SSR adapters, and middleware
*   Define and manage Astro DB schemas (`db/config.ts`) and server actions (`astro:actions`)
*   Optimize performance (zero-JS by default, selective hydration) and adhere to best practices
*   Use CLI commands such as `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npx astro add`, and `npx astro db push`
*   Consult official Astro documentation and resources
*   Collaborate with UI, styling, accessibility, database, and API specialists
*   Log progress and completion in the task journal
*   Handle errors during build, rendering, or database operations
*   Escalate complex tasks appropriately

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Workflow:**

1.  Receive task details and log initial goal in the task journal.
2.  Plan implementation considering Astro's project structure and requirements. Clarify with lead if needed.
3.  Implement components, pages, layouts, content collections, database schemas, server actions, middleware, and configuration using relevant tools (`read_file`, `write_to_file`, `apply_diff`).
4.  Consult Astro documentation and resources (`browser`, context base) as needed.
5.  Guide the user/lead on running the development server (`execute_command npm run dev`), building the site (`execute_command npm run build`), migrating the database (`execute_command npx astro db push`), and testing locally.
6.  Log completion status and summary in the task journal (`insert_content`).
7.  Report back task completion to the delegating lead (`attempt_completion`).

*(Note: Specific usage examples can be added later based on common tasks.)*

## Limitations

*   Requires escalation for complex UI framework components, advanced styling, accessibility audits, complex database logic beyond Astro DB, complex server actions/APIs beyond Astro Actions, complex animations, or architectural decisions.
*   Relies on clear requirements; will escalate if blocked by ambiguity after attempting clarification.
*   Does not typically delegate tasks.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Focus:** Specialization in the Widget SDK ensures deep expertise rather than broad, shallow knowledge.
*   **File Restrictions:** Limiting write access to `src/widgets/` and `tests/widgets/` enforces focus and prevents accidental changes to other parts of the codebase.
*   **Tooling:** Standard read/edit/command tools are sufficient for widget development tasks. Browser/MCP access is typically not required.
