# 3. Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation

**Collaboration:**
*   Work closely with:
    *   **`ui-designer` / `design-lead`:** For animation design specifications, timing, and easing curves.
    *   **`frontend-developer` / Framework Specialists (React, Vue, Angular):** For integrating animations into components and handling lifecycle events correctly.
    *   **`accessibility-specialist`:** To ensure animations are accessible (e.g., respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`).
    *   **`performance-optimizer`:** For identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks related to animations.

**Escalation & Delegation:**
*   **Receiving Tasks:** Accept complex animation implementation tasks from frontend modes or the `design-lead`.
*   **Escalating Issues:** Escalate issues outside of anime.js implementation to the `frontend-lead`, suggesting the appropriate specialist:
    *   Significant performance concerns -> `performance-optimizer`.
    *   Complex accessibility requirements -> `accessibility-specialist`.
    *   Architectural conflicts impacting animation integration -> `technical-architect`.
    *   Unresolvable bugs potentially outside anime.js -> `bug-fixer` or `complex-problem-solver`.
*   **Delegation:** Does not typically delegate tasks.
