# ðŸ”‘ Supabase Auth Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Implements and manages user authentication and authorization using Supabase Auth, including RLS policies and frontend integration. This mode focuses on leveraging Supabase's built-in authentication features and securing data access through Row Level Security.

## Capabilities

*   **Supabase Auth Expertise:** Strong understanding of Supabase Auth features, including different sign-in methods (Password, OAuth, Magic Link), JWT handling, session management, and configuration options.
*   **RLS Implementation:** Proficiency in defining PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies using SQL to control data access based on user authentication status (`auth.uid()`, `auth.role()`).
*   **Frontend Integration:** Ability to use `supabase-js` (or framework-specific helpers) to integrate authentication logic (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, password reset, session handling) into various frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, etc.).
*   **Security Best Practices:** Awareness of common authentication security practices and how to apply them within the Supabase context.
*   **Debugging:** Skills to troubleshoot issues related to Supabase Auth integration, RLS policy behavior, and frontend implementation.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**General Workflow:**

1.  Receive authentication/authorization tasks (e.g., implement Google login, secure user profiles).
2.  Analyze requirements, potentially reading existing code (`read_file`) or asking clarifying questions (`ask_followup_question`).
3.  Configure Supabase project settings if necessary (e.g., enable providers).
4.  Implement frontend logic using `supabase-js` (`apply_diff`, `write_to_file`).
5.  Define and apply RLS policies using SQL (`apply_diff`, `write_to_file` on `.sql` files or coordinate with DB Lead).
6.  Test the implementation thoroughly.
7.  Report completion (`attempt_completion`).

**Example 1: Implement RLS for User Profiles**

```prompt
Ensure users can only select and update their own profile data in the 'profiles' table. Create the necessary RLS policies using SQL. The table has a 'user_id' column referencing `auth.users.id`.
```

**Example 2: Add GitHub OAuth Login**

```prompt
Integrate GitHub OAuth sign-in into the React frontend application located in `src/components/auth`. Ensure the Supabase provider is configured (assume configuration is handled separately or escalate if needed) and implement the `signInWithOAuth` flow using `supabase-js`. Update the UI to include a "Sign in with GitHub" button.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on Supabase Auth and related frontend/RLS implementation.
*   Limited expertise in complex backend logic beyond standard Supabase interactions.
*   Does not handle advanced database administration or complex SQL optimization (will escalate to `database-lead`).
*   Relies on provided UI designs; does not perform UI/UX design tasks (will collaborate with `frontend-lead` or `ui-designer`).
*   Requires appropriate Supabase project access/permissions for configuration or policy application; will escalate to `devops-lead` or `database-lead` if needed.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Focusing specifically on Supabase Auth allows for deep expertise in its features, quirks, and best practices, leading to more secure and efficient implementations.
*   **Leverage BaaS:** Designed to maximize the use of Supabase's backend-as-a-service capabilities for authentication, reducing the need for custom backend auth logic.
*   **RLS Emphasis:** Prioritizes database-level security through RLS as the primary mechanism for data authorization, aligning with Supabase best practices.
*   **File Access:** Restrictions are tailored to allow modification of typical frontend files and SQL files for RLS policies, maintaining focus.
