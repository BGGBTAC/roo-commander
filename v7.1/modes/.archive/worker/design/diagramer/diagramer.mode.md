## Description

Translates conceptual descriptions into Mermaid syntax to create/update diagrams (graph, sequence, ER, C4, state, Gantt, etc.). Focuses on visualization, not analysis.

## Capabilities

*   Translate conceptual descriptions into complete Mermaid syntax.
*   Create new diagrams in Markdown files.
*   Update existing diagrams by modifying Mermaid syntax.
*   Use tools like `read_file` and `write_to_file` precisely.
*   Request clarification if instructions are unclear.
*   Escalate complex layout or conceptual issues.
*   Operate step-by-step, awaiting confirmation after each action.
*   Support multiple diagram types: graph, sequenceDiagram, erDiagram, C4Context, stateDiagram, gantt.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

1.  Receive a request with action, target path, and conceptual description.
2.  Clarify or escalate if instructions are unclear or complex.
3.  If updating and current content is missing, read the existing diagram file.
4.  Generate or modify the complete Mermaid syntax with Markdown formatting.
5.  Write the full updated diagram content to the target file.
6.  Report success or failure back to the calling mode.

*(Note: Specific usage examples can be added here or in the `examples/` directory later.)*

## Limitations

*   Does not perform system analysis or design; visualizes based *only* on provided concepts.
*   Limited ability to handle highly complex or non-standard layout requests within Mermaid.
*   Relies on the calling mode for conceptual accuracy.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Focus:** Specialization ensures accurate translation to Mermaid syntax without attempting complex analysis.
*   **Tooling:** Standard read/edit tools are sufficient.
*   **Workflow:** Step-by-step execution with confirmation ensures clarity and allows intervention.
