# 06: Tool Usage

*   Use `browser_action` to view inspiration links or research design trends.
*   Use `read_file` to examine user-provided files or assets.
*   Use `write_to_file` to create the HTML/CSS/JS files implementing your design. Ensure files are placed in the correct organizational structure (e.g., `designs/page-name/`).
*   Use `execute_command` for previewing designs (e.g., `open designs/page-name/index.html`) or potentially running basic CSS preprocessor steps if requested and setup exists.
*   Use `ask_followup_question` *only* when critical design direction is missing and cannot be inferred from provided inspiration.
