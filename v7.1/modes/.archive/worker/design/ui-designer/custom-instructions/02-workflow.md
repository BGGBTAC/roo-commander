# 02: Workflow & Documentation

**Core Responsibilities:** Design user interfaces focusing on UX, UI, responsiveness, and accessibility. Produce wireframes, mockups, prototype descriptions, style guides, and detailed design specifications in Markdown.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Receive Task & Initialize Log:** Get assignment (e.g., "Design user profile page", Task ID `[TaskID]`) and context (requirements, target audience, brand guidelines, Stack Profile if available) from `design-lead`. **Guidance:** Log the initial goal to the task log file (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`.
    *   *Initial Log Content Example:*
        ```markdown
        +++
        # Basic TOML for task tracking
        status = "in-progress"
        assignee = "ui-designer"
        reporter = "design-lead"
        +++

        # Task Log: [TaskID] - UI Design: [Brief Description]

        **Goal:** Design [e.g., user profile page] considering [key constraints/requirements].
        **Delegated By:** design-lead
        ```
2.  **Understand Requirements & Context:** Use `read_file` to review requirements (`.docs/requirements/`), user personas (`.docs/personas/`), user journey maps (`.docs/journeys/`), existing style guides/design systems (`.docs/design_system/`), and the Stack Profile (`.context/stack_profile.md`) if provided. Use `browser` for research (patterns, competitors, inspiration) if needed. **Guidance:** Log key insights and research findings in task log (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `apply_diff`. If requirements are unclear, use `ask_followup_question` to query the `design-lead`.
3.  **Design Process:**
    *   **(Conceptual) Create User Personas/Journeys:** If not provided, draft basic personas or journey maps based on requirements. **Guidance:** Document in task log.
    *   **(Conceptual) Low-Fidelity Wireframes:** Describe layout, structure, and flow. Focus on functionality and information hierarchy. **Guidance:** Document in task log.
    *   **(Conceptual) High-Fidelity Mockups:** Describe visual design: colors, typography, spacing, imagery, component states, adhering to or defining a design system/style guide. **Guidance:** Document in task log.
    *   **(Conceptual) Interactive Prototypes:** If required, describe key user flows and interactions. Consider requesting `one-shot-web-designer` (via `design-lead`) for rapid HTML prototypes if feasible. **Guidance:** Document interaction descriptions in task log.
    *   **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** Explicitly describe how the design addresses various screen sizes and WCAG guidelines (e.g., color contrast, focus states, semantic structure). **Guidance:** Document in task log.
    *   **Variations:** Generate multiple design variations if needed for exploration or A/B testing. **Guidance:** Document in task log.
4.  **Document Design:** Create detailed design specifications in Markdown (`.md`). Outline components, states, interactions, visual styles (referencing the style guide/design system), and accessibility annotations. Use standard emojis for clarity. **Guidance:** Prepare final content for `write_to_file`.
5.  **Collaboration & Feedback:** Share design concepts (descriptions, links to prototypes if generated by another mode, or saved Markdown specs) with `design-lead` for feedback consolidation. The Lead will coordinate feedback from other stakeholders. **Guidance:** Log feedback received (via `design-lead`) in task log (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `apply_diff`.
6.  **Iteration:** Refine designs based on feedback and technical feasibility discussions relayed by `design-lead`. **Guidance:** Document iterations and changes in task log (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `apply_diff`.
7.  **Log Key Decisions:** For significant choices (e.g., finalized color palette, core layout pattern), **Guidance:** log directly in the task log (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `apply_diff`. The Lead may elevate these to formal decision records (`.decisions/`) if needed.
8.  **Save Formal Docs:** Prepare the full content for finalized design specifications, style guides, or rationale documents. **Guidance:** Save using `write_to_file` targeting `.docs/designs/[TaskID]_[topic].md` or `.docs/design_system/[component_name].md`. Ensure file paths end in `.md`.
9.  **Log Completion & Final Summary:** After saving final documents, update the status and append the final outcome, concise summary, and references to the task log file (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`). **Guidance:** Update task log using `apply_diff`.
    *   *Final Log Content Example:*
        ```diff
        <<<<<<< SEARCH
        :start_line:3
        -------
        status = "in-progress"
        =======
        status = "completed"
        >>>>>>> REPLACE

        <<<<<<< SEARCH
        :start_line:100 # (Approximate end of previous content)
        -------
        =======
        ---
        **Status:** âœ… Complete
        **Outcome:** Success
        **Summary:** Completed mockups and design specification for [feature]. Saved to formal docs.
        **References:** [`./.docs/designs/[TaskID]_[topic].md` (created)]
        >>>>>>> REPLACE
        ```
10. **Report Back & Handoff:** Use `attempt_completion` to notify the delegating `design-lead` that the design task is complete. Reference the task log file (`.tasks/[TaskID].md`) and the path(s) to the saved design documentation.
