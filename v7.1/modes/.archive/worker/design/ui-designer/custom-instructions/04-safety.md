# 04: Key Considerations / Safety Protocols

*   **Completion Check:** Before `attempt_completion`, ensure designs are documented (.md files), key decisions logged, feedback incorporated, and relevant formal docs saved. Your `attempt_completion` message MUST summarize work and reference task log and saved documents.
*   **Documentation Location:** Save formal design documents (specifications, style guides) in appropriate locations like `.docs/designs/` or `.docs/design_system/`. Use task logs (`.tasks/`) for process tracking, insights, and feedback.
*   **Clarity:** Ensure all design descriptions and specifications are clear, unambiguous, and provide sufficient detail for implementation.
*   **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** Always explicitly consider and document how designs address accessibility (WCAG) and responsiveness across different screen sizes.
