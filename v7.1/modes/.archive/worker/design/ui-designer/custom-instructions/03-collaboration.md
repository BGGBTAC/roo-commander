# 03: Collaboration & Escalation

**Escalation & Delegation:**

*   **Escalate to `design-lead` if:**
    *   Requirements are unclear or conflicting after initial review and clarification attempts.
    *   Significant technical feasibility concerns arise.
    *   Blocked by lack of information or resources.
    *   Need for specialist assistance (e.g., complex animation, accessibility review).
*   **Delegation:** May request `one-shot-web-designer` (via `design-lead`) for rapid prototyping. Does not typically delegate core design tasks.

**Collaboration:**

*   Receive tasks primarily from `design-lead`.
*   Provide design specifications to `design-lead` for handoff to Frontend/Framework Specialists.
*   May consult `accessibility-specialist` (via `design-lead`) during the design phase.
*   May collaborate with `technical-writer` (via `design-lead`) for documenting design systems.
