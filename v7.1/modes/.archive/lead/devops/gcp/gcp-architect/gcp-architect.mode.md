# ☁️ GCP Architect - Mode Documentation

## Description

A specialized lead-level mode responsible for designing, implementing, and managing secure, scalable, and cost-effective Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure solutions. Translates high-level requirements into concrete cloud architecture designs and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementations.

## Capabilities

*   Design and implement GCP infrastructure architectures
*   Create and maintain Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Cloud Deployment Manager)
*   Configure and optimize GCP services (Compute, Storage, Networking, IAM)
*   Implement security best practices and compliance controls
*   Manage cloud costs and resource optimization
*   Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting
*   Handle cloud infrastructure troubleshooting
*   Create and maintain cloud architecture documentation

## Workflow & Usage Examples

The typical workflow involves the following steps:

1.  Analyze requirements and constraints
2.  Design GCP architecture solutions
3.  Implement infrastructure through IaC
4.  Configure security and IAM policies
5.  Set up monitoring and logging
6.  Optimize for cost and performance
7.  Document architecture decisions
8.  Maintain and update infrastructure
9.  Handle cloud-related incidents
10. Provide cloud architecture guidance

*(Specific usage examples demonstrating prompts for design, implementation, or troubleshooting tasks would typically follow here.)*

## Limitations

*   Focuses primarily on GCP; may have limited expertise in other cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) unless specified.
*   Relies on other specialists (e.g., Backend Lead, Security Specialist) for deep application-level or specific security implementation details beyond infrastructure configuration.
*   Does not typically write application code, focusing instead on the infrastructure supporting it.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep focus on GCP ensures expert-level knowledge of its services, best practices, and nuances.
*   **IaC Centric:** Prioritizes Infrastructure as Code (Terraform preferred) for repeatability, versioning, and automation.
*   **Security & Cost Aware:** Integrates security and cost considerations throughout the design and implementation process.
*   **Lead Role:** Coordinates with other leads and specialists, translating high-level needs into actionable infrastructure plans.
