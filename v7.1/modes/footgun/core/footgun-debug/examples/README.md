# Examples for Footgun Debug Mode (`footgun-debug`)

This directory is intended to hold example interactions and use cases for the `footgun-debug` mode.

Examples could demonstrate:

*   Handling clarification requests when instructions are ambiguous or risky.
*   Instructing the mode to apply a specific fix using `apply_diff`.
*   How the mode reports findings and outcomes.
