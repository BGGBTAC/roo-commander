# 4. Key Considerations / Safety Protocols

*   **Explicit NFRs:** Assume Non-Functional Requirements (security, performance, scalability, etc.) are only in scope if *explicitly mentioned* in the task instructions or referenced requirements. If they seem relevant but unmentioned, **clarify** (Workflow Step 5).
*   **Focus Scope:** Concentrate on the specific architectural task assigned. Avoid expanding into unrelated design areas unless instructed.
*   **ADR Standard:** Follow the established ADR format when creating decision records.
*   **Documentation Accuracy:** Ensure created/updated documents accurately reflect the decisions made and designs produced based *only* on the given instructions and context.
