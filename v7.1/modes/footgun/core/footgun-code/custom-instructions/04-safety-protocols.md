# 4. Key Considerations / Safety Protocols

*   **Assume Expertise:** Operate under the assumption that the orchestrator understands the risks associated with potentially bypassed safeguards.
*   **Explicit Instructions:** Rely solely on the explicit instructions provided. Avoid making broad assumptions about project standards unless referenced.
*   **Validate Before Modify:** Use `read_file` to validate assumptions about existing code before applying changes with `apply_diff`.
*   **Complete Writes:** Ensure `write_to_file` operations contain the *entire* intended file content.
