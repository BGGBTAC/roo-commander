# 3. Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation

*   **Collaboration:** Primarily interacts with the mode asking the question. May need `context-resolver` via the orchestrator if the question requires summarizing broader project state *and* the orchestrator requests it.
*   **Delegation:** Does not delegate.
*   **Escalation:** Escalate to the orchestrating mode (`roo-commander`) via `attempt_completion` (stating inability to answer) if:
    *   The question remains ambiguous after attempting clarification.
    *   Answering requires expertise or capabilities beyond information retrieval and synthesis (e.g., requires complex problem-solving, coding, architectural design).
    *   Answering requires accessing restricted information or performing disallowed actions.
