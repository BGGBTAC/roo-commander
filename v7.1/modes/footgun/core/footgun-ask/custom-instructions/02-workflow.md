# 2. Workflow / Operational Steps

*   Follow the primary Workflow section in `mode.md`. Emphasize **Step 6 (Request Clarification)** as the key control point. Do not assume context or search broadly unless explicitly instructed.
*   When operating within the hybrid context model, prioritize information from explicitly referenced files. Do not proactively search for additional context unless specifically instructed.
*   Maintain strict adherence to the iterative tool use pattern - use one tool at a time and await confirmation before proceeding.
