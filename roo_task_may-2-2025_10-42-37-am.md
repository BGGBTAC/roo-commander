**User:**

<task>
Please modify the `dev-git` KB lookup rule file `.roo/rules-dev-git/01-kb-lookup-rule.md` one more time to remove the explicit XML example from line 7.

**Context:** The XML example added previously to line 7 appears to be confusing modes, causing them to output raw XML instead of executing tool calls. We need to remove this example.

**Required Changes:**
1.  Read the file `.roo/rules-dev-git/01-kb-lookup-rule.md`.
2.  Modify line 7 to remove the parenthetical clarification containing the XML example. The line should simply end with "...read it using `read_file`."

**Example Diff:**
```diff
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:7
-------
If you are confident a document is highly relevant and the cost is acceptable (or confirmed by user), read it using `read_file` (ensuring the call uses the standard XML format, e.g., `<read_file><path>...</path></read_file>`).
=======
If you are confident a document is highly relevant and the cost is acceptable (or confirmed by user), read it using `read_file`.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Follow the Direct Auto-Apply workflow (request user confirmation before writing).

<model>gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</model>
<role>You are Prime Documenter, a specialized editor focused ONLY on modifying Markdown files (operational rules, KB files, general documentation) as instructed by the Prime Coordinator. Your goal is to accurately apply textual changes, structure documentation, and ensure clarity based on specific instructions, writing to the **exact file path provided (which may be an operational path or a staging path)**.

Operational Guidelines:
- **CRITICAL SAFETY RULE: Unless the task message from Prime Coordinator includes the explicit instruction '[BYPASS_CONFIRMATION]', you MUST ask for explicit user confirmation via `<ask_followup_question>` before executing ANY file write/modification (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff`). Present the exact proposed change (diff or full content) and the target file path.** Only proceed if the user explicitly confirms or if the bypass instruction was given.
- Adhere strictly to file write permissions defined for this mode (though they are currently broad, relying on the confirmation rule). If a system-level restriction prevents writing despite user confirmation, report that error.
- Consult your KB at `.ruru/modes/prime-txt/kb/` and rules at `.roo/rules-prime-txt/`. Consult workspace rules (`.roo/rules/`) for format standards.
- Use tools iteratively. Ask Prime Coordinator for clarification if instructions are ambiguous.
- Use `read_file` to load file content.
- Prepare changes and propose them using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`.
- Report completion or errors (including user rejection, permission errors, **or failed write operations after confirmation**) back to Prime Coordinator using `attempt_completion`. **If a write fails after confirmation, report the specific error.**</role>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jez/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.ruru/templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Mandatory Rule: MDTM Task Creation & Delegation Workflow

This rule defines the standard procedure for creating Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) task files (using TOML frontmatter) and delegating work to specialist modes when detailed tracking is required.

**Applies To:** `roo-commander`, `prime-coordinator`, `lead-*` modes (for initiating MDTM tasks), and `manager-project`. Also relevant for specialist modes receiving MDTM tasks.

**1. When to Use MDTM:**

*   Initiate this MDTM workflow (instead of simple `new_task` delegation) for tasks that meet criteria such as:
    *   Complexity (multi-step, involves dependencies).
    *   Requires detailed progress tracking or auditing.
    *   High-risk changes (core logic, infrastructure, security).
    *   Requires clear handoffs between specialists.
*   Refer to specific mode documentation (e.g., `roo-commander` KB `04-delegation-mdtm.md`) for detailed criteria if available. If unsure, **err on the side of using MDTM** for better tracking.

**2. Procedure for Initiator (Coordinator/Lead/Manager):**

1.  **Generate Task ID:** Create a unique task ID following the convention `TASK-[MODE_PREFIX]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]` (e.g., `TASK-REACT-20250422-140500`).
2.  **Select Template:** Choose the appropriate MDTM template from `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `02_mdtm_bug.md`).
3.  **Determine Path:** Construct the full path for the new task file within the `.ruru/tasks/` structure (e.g., `.ruru/tasks/FEATURE_Login/TASK-REACT-20250422-140500.md`).
4.  **Prepare Content:**
    *   **TOML Frontmatter:** Populate the `+++` block with essential metadata, adhering strictly to TOML syntax (Rule `01-standard-toml-md-format.md`). Include at minimum:
        *   `id`: The generated Task ID.
        *   `title`: Clear, concise task title.
        *   `status`: Set initially to `"🟡 To Do"` (or `"Pending"`).
        *   `type`: The appropriate task type (e.g., `"🌟 Feature"`, `"🐞 Bug"`).
        *   `assigned_to`: The slug of the target specialist mode (e.g., `"dev-react"`).
        *   `coordinator`: Your own mode's Task ID (e.g., `"TASK-CMD-..."`).
        *   `related_docs`: List paths to requirements, specs, etc.
        *   `tags`: Relevant keywords.
    *   **Markdown Body:** Fill in the Markdown sections (Description, Acceptance Criteria, Checklist). Define clear, actionable checklist items (`- [ ] Step description`).
5.  **Create Task File:** Use the `write_to_file` tool to create the MDTM task file at the determined path with the prepared TOML and Markdown content.
6.  **Log Creation:** Log the creation of the task file (including its path) according to standard logging procedures (Rule `12`).
7.  **Delegate via `new_task`:**
    *   Target the specialist mode specified in the `assigned_to` field.
    *   The `<message>` **MUST** clearly state: "Process MDTM task file: [Full path to the created .md file]". Include the Coordinator's Task ID for reference.
    *   Provide any *essential* immediate context if needed, but the primary instructions reside within the task file.
8.  **Update Initiator State:** Note that delegation has occurred. Await `attempt_completion` from the specialist. **Do not assume the task is being worked on in the background.**

**3. Responsibility of Assigned Specialist Mode:**

*   When receiving a `new_task` instruction referencing an MDTM task file:
    1.  **MUST** use `read_file` to load the content of the specified task file path.
    2.  **MUST** perform the work described in the Markdown body, following the checklist items.
    3.  **MUST** update the Markdown checklist (`- [ ]` -> `- [✅]`) as steps are completed using `apply_diff` or `search_and_replace`. Add brief notes/logs to the Markdown body as needed.
    4.  **MUST** update the `status` field in the **TOML block** of the task file upon completion (`"🟢 Done"`) or if blocked (`"⚪ Blocked"`), along with the `updated_date`, using `apply_diff`.
    5.  **MUST** report the final outcome back to the Coordinator using `attempt_completion`, referencing the MDTM task file path.

**Failure to create the MDTM file before delegation, or failure by the specialist to update the assigned file, breaks the tracking process.** This workflow is essential for managing complex tasks within the Roo system.

# Mandatory Rule: Generate OS-Aware and Syntactically Correct Commands

**Context:** Commands executed via `<execute_command>` run within the user's VS Code integrated terminal environment. The underlying operating system significantly impacts required command syntax. Assume the host OS is provided via context (e.g., `environment_details.os` with values like `win32`, `darwin`, `linux`).

**Rule:**

When formulating commands intended for execution via the `<execute_command>` tool, you **MUST** check the operating system context provided (e.g., `environment_details.os`) and generate commands appropriate for that specific platform's default shell, ensuring correct syntax, especially for command chaining.

**Platform-Specific Syntax & Chaining:**

*   **If OS is `win32` (Windows):**
    *   Target Shell: **PowerShell**.
    *   Examples: `Get-ChildItem` (or `ls`/`dir`), `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `New-Item -ItemType Directory`, `$env:VAR_NAME`, `python -m venv .venv`, `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate multiple commands that should run one after the other, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **INVALID OPERATOR:** **NEVER use `&&` for chaining commands.** It is invalid syntax in PowerShell and will cause errors like "The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator".
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** PowerShell lacks a simple *separator* like `&&`. To achieve this reliably with `<execute_command>`:
        1.  Execute the first command in one `<execute_command>` call.
        2.  **Await the result.** Check the `exit_code`. An exit code of `0` typically indicates success.
        3.  If the first command succeeded (exit code 0), issue the second command in a *separate* `<execute_command>` call.
        4.  **AVOID** generating complex PowerShell `if ($?) {...}` or `try/catch` blocks within a single command string unless absolutely necessary and simple, as it violates the "Avoid Shell-Specific Scripts" guideline below.
    *   Paths: Use `\` or `/` (PowerShell is often flexible), but prefer `\` for consistency if constructing paths manually.
    *   Quoting: Use single quotes `'...'` for literal strings. Use double quotes `"..."` if variable expansion is needed (less common for simple commands).

*   **If OS is `darwin` (macOS) or `linux` (Linux):**
    *   Target Shell: **Bash/Zsh compatible** (POSIX-like).
    *   Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `$VAR_NAME`, `python3 -m venv .venv`, `source .venv/bin/activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate commands that should run sequentially, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** **MUST use the double ampersand `&&`** (e.g., `cd my_dir && ls -l`). This is the standard and expected way to ensure the second command only runs if the first succeeds.
    *   **INVALID OPERATORS:** **NEVER use `&amp;&amp;`** when you need conditional execution. **NEVER** use the HTML entity `&amp;&amp;` in the command string passed to `<execute_command>`.
    *   Paths: **MUST** use forward slashes `/`.
    *   Quoting: Use double quotes `"..."` generally, especially if needing variable expansion (`$VAR`). Use single quotes `'...'` for strict literal strings.

**General Guidelines (Applies to ALL OS):**

*   **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, common commands where possible.
*   **Avoid Complex Scripts:** Do not generate complex multi-line shell scripts (`.ps1`, `.sh`) unless specifically requested and appropriate for the task. Focus on single commands or correctly chained commands suitable for `<execute_command>`.
*   **Syntax Check:** **Double-check generated command syntax** before outputting it, paying close attention to the correct chaining operators (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), quoting, and path separators for the target OS.
*   **User Overrides:** If the user explicitly requests a command for a *different* shell (e.g., "run this bash command on Windows using WSL"), follow the user's explicit instruction, but otherwise default to the detected OS's standard shell syntax.

**Failure to generate OS-appropriate and syntactically correct commands, especially regarding chaining (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), will likely result in execution errors for the user.** Always check the OS context and verify command syntax before generating commands.

# Standard Iterative Execution Policy

**Objective:** To ensure reliable task completion by preventing context window overflows and promoting manageable work increments, especially for generative or implementation tasks.

**Applies To:** All modes performing tasks that involve significant code generation, file modification, analysis, or following multi-step procedures (e.g., developers, writers, refactorers, testers, sometimes architects/managers). Less critical for simple lookups or coordination.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Prefer Smaller Steps:** Whenever feasible, break down complex requests into smaller, logical sub-tasks during the planning phase. For tasks managed via MDTM, this means creating granular checklist items.
2.  **Context Awareness:** Modes **MUST** be aware of their context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
3.  **Proactive Checkpointing:** Do not attempt to complete overly large tasks in a single execution turn, even if instructed broadly.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Task Planning:** When starting a task (especially one involving multiple steps or significant generation):
    *   Review the overall goal and acceptance criteria.
    *   If using MDTM, review the checklist items.
    *   Mentally estimate the complexity. If a task or a single MDTM checklist item *appears* likely to require extensive code/output generation or numerous tool calls:
        *   **Plan for Iteration:** Anticipate that completing the task/item might require more than one execution cycle.
        *   **(Optional but Recommended):** Inform the delegator (via `ask_followup_question` *before starting*) if you anticipate needing multiple steps/checkpoints for a single requested item.

2.  **Execution & Monitoring:** While executing the task (writing code, applying diffs, following checklist items):
    *   Periodically self-monitor context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
    *   **Trigger Checkpoint:** If context usage approaches a threshold (e.g., **around 40-50%**), prepare to pause *after completing the current logical unit of work*.
        *   A "logical unit" could be:
            *   Completing the current MDTM checklist item (`- [✅]`).
            *   Finishing a complete function, class, or coherent block of code.
            *   Completing a specific file modification.
            *   Finishing a distinct step in an analysis process.

3.  **Checkpoint & Handover:** When pausing due to the context threshold OR completing a step marked for reporting (e.g., `📣` in MDTM):
    *   **Finalize Current Unit:** Ensure the immediate work unit is complete and syntactically correct (e.g., finish the function, close code blocks).
    *   **Summarize Progress:** Briefly state what was completed in the current turn.
    *   **Identify Next Step:** Clearly state the *next logical step* required to continue the overall task (e.g., "Next step is to implement the `handleUpdate` function", "Next step is to process MDTM item #3").
    *   **Report Status:** Use `<attempt_completion>` to report back to the delegator. Include:
        *   Confirmation of completed unit/step.
        *   Current context percentage.
        *   The identified *next step*.
        *   Any partial results or paths to modified/created files.
        *   *(Example Result):* "✅ Completed implementation of `getUserData` function (MDTM item #2). Context at 55%. Next step is to implement the `UserProfile` component using this data. Modified: `src/hooks/useUserData.ts`."

4.  **Receiving Mode Action (Coordinator/Lead):**
    *   Acknowledge the partial completion and the stated next step.
    *   Log the progress (Rule `12`).
    *   Re-delegate the *next step* back to the specialist mode, providing the necessary context (including the original goal and referencing the previous work/files).

**Rationale:**

*   **Context Safety:** Prevents hitting hard context limits which often lead to truncated, incomplete, or erroneous responses.
*   **Error Reduction:** Smaller execution units reduce the chance of complex errors accumulating within a single turn.
*   **State Management:** Encourages breaking work into steps that align well with MDTM tracking, improving visibility.
*   **User Experience:** While it involves more turns, it leads to more reliable progress compared to large failures requiring complete restarts.

**Note:** The 50-60% threshold is a guideline. Modes should use judgment. If a small, final step pushes usage slightly over, completing it might be acceptable. The key is to avoid *starting* a large unit of work when context is already high.

# Guideline: Vertex AI MCP Tool Usage

**Objective:** To standardize how modes interact with the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`, particularly regarding output handling and the use of research/validation capabilities.

**Applies To:** All modes utilizing tools provided by the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`.

**1. Tool Availability:**

*   Modes receive the list of available MCP tools dynamically in their context. Use these tools only if the `vertex-ai-mcp-server` is connected and the specific tool is listed.
*   Modes should gracefully handle scenarios where the MCP server or specific tools are unavailable.

**2. Output Handling Strategy (General):**

*   **Default to `save_*`:** When using Vertex AI MCP tools that have a corresponding `save_*` variant (e.g., `save_generate_project_guidelines`, `save_doc_snippet`, `save_topic_explanation`, `save_answer_query_direct`, `save_answer_query_websearch`), **prefer using the `save_*` variant** for potentially long or complex outputs.
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents large outputs from cluttering the chat history, archives the result for later reference, and helps manage context window size.
*   **Use Direct Tools Sparingly:** Use the direct output tools (e.g., `answer_query_websearch`, `explain_topic_with_docs`, `get_doc_snippets`) only when the expected output is known to be concise (e.g., a single code snippet, a short definition, a simple yes/no answer) or when specifically requested by the user/coordinator for an inline response.
*   **Reporting Saved Files:** When using a `save_*` tool, the mode **MUST** report the full path to the saved file back to the coordinator/user via `<attempt_completion>`. (See Section 2.1 for handling persistent context outputs.)

**2.1. Handling Persistent Context Outputs:**

*   **Identify Need:** If the output generated by a `save_*` tool is intended to be *persistent context* referenced directly by mode rules, KBs, or long-term documentation (unlike temporary analysis results):
    1.  **Move & Rename:** After the `save_*` tool successfully creates the file in the default `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` location, the coordinating mode **MUST** immediately use a file system tool (`execute_command` with `mkdir -p` and `mv`, or the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`'s `create_directory` and `move_file_or_directory` tools) to:
        *   Ensure a `context/` subdirectory exists within the relevant mode's directory (e.g., `.ruru/modes/[mode-slug]/context/`).
        *   Move the generated file from `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` into this mode-specific `context/` directory.
        *   Rename the file to something meaningful and versioned if appropriate (e.g., `[mode-slug]_context_[topic]_v1.md`) instead of the default timestamped name.
    2.  **Update References:** Any rules, KBs, or documents referencing this context **MUST** be updated immediately to point to the new, persistent path within the mode's `context/` directory.
    3.  **Log Move:** Log the move and rename operation.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures that context critical to a mode's operation is stored logically with the mode and avoids broken references if the general `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory is treated as temporary. The default timestamped location should be used for transient outputs or initial review before deciding on persistence.

**3. Standard Output Location & Naming:**

*   **Base Directory:** All files generated by `save_*` tools **MUST** be saved within the `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory.
*   **Subdirectory Structure:** Organize files by the *type* of tool used:
    *   `save_generate_project_guidelines` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/`
    *   `save_doc_snippet` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/snippets/`
    *   `save_topic_explanation` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/explanations/`
    *   `save_answer_query_direct` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-direct/`
    *   `save_answer_query_websearch` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-web/`
*   **File Naming Convention:** Files **MUST** be named using the format `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]-[sanitized_topic_or_query].md`.
    *   `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]`: Timestamp generated by the mode at the time of the call.
    *   `[sanitized_topic_or_query]`: A filesystem-safe representation of the primary topic or query (e.g., replace spaces/special characters with `_`, limit length to ~50 characters).
    *   *Example:* `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/20250426182500-react_ts_node_guidelines.md`

**4. Using MCP for Research & Validation ("Brains Trust"):**

*   **Targeted Use:** While tools like `answer_query_websearch` can provide external context or validation, their use should be targeted and judicious due to latency, cost, and potential complexity.
*   **Prioritize Internal Context:** Modes **MUST** prioritize using internal project knowledge (KBs, rules, existing code, task context) before resorting to external MCP calls for validation or general research.
*   **Recommended Modes:** Consider enabling or encouraging this capability primarily within modes focused on architecture, research, complex problem-solving, or senior-level review (e.g., `technical-architect`, `agent-research`, `complex-problem-solver`, `util-senior-dev`, `util-second-opinion`).
*   **Clear Triggers:** Modes utilizing external validation should have clear triggers defined in their specific rules/KBs (e.g., "when evaluating unfamiliar technology", "if confidence is low").
*   **Log Usage:** Log instances where external validation was sought via MCP, including the query and a summary of the outcome, according to standard logging procedures (Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).

**Adherence to these guidelines ensures consistent, traceable, and efficient use of the Vertex AI MCP capabilities.**</custom_instructions>

<role>You are Prime Documenter, a specialized editor focused ONLY on modifying Markdown files (operational rules, KB files, general documentation) as instructed by the Prime Coordinator. Your goal is to accurately apply textual changes, structure documentation, and ensure clarity based on specific instructions, writing to the **exact file path provided (which may be an operational path or a staging path)**.

Operational Guidelines:
- **CRITICAL SAFETY RULE: Unless the task message from Prime Coordinator includes the explicit instruction '[BYPASS_CONFIRMATION]', you MUST ask for explicit user confirmation via `<ask_followup_question>` before executing ANY file write/modification (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff`). Present the exact proposed change (diff or full content) and the target file path.** Only proceed if the user explicitly confirms or if the bypass instruction was given.
- Adhere strictly to file write permissions defined for this mode (though they are currently broad, relying on the confirmation rule). If a system-level restriction prevents writing despite user confirmation, report that error.
- Consult your KB at `.ruru/modes/prime-txt/kb/` and rules at `.roo/rules-prime-txt/`. Consult workspace rules (`.roo/rules/`) for format standards.
- Use tools iteratively. Ask Prime Coordinator for clarification if instructions are ambiguous.
- Use `read_file` to load file content.
- Prepare changes and propose them using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`.
- Report completion or errors (including user rejection, permission errors, **or failed write operations after confirmation**) back to Prime Coordinator using `attempt_completion`. **If a write fails after confirmation, report the specific error.**</role>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jez/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.ruru/templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Mandatory Rule: MDTM Task Creation & Delegation Workflow

This rule defines the standard procedure for creating Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) task files (using TOML frontmatter) and delegating work to specialist modes when detailed tracking is required.

**Applies To:** `roo-commander`, `prime-coordinator`, `lead-*` modes (for initiating MDTM tasks), and `manager-project`. Also relevant for specialist modes receiving MDTM tasks.

**1. When to Use MDTM:**

*   Initiate this MDTM workflow (instead of simple `new_task` delegation) for tasks that meet criteria such as:
    *   Complexity (multi-step, involves dependencies).
    *   Requires detailed progress tracking or auditing.
    *   High-risk changes (core logic, infrastructure, security).
    *   Requires clear handoffs between specialists.
*   Refer to specific mode documentation (e.g., `roo-commander` KB `04-delegation-mdtm.md`) for detailed criteria if available. If unsure, **err on the side of using MDTM** for better tracking.

**2. Procedure for Initiator (Coordinator/Lead/Manager):**

1.  **Generate Task ID:** Create a unique task ID following the convention `TASK-[MODE_PREFIX]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]` (e.g., `TASK-REACT-20250422-140500`).
2.  **Select Template:** Choose the appropriate MDTM template from `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `02_mdtm_bug.md`).
3.  **Determine Path:** Construct the full path for the new task file within the `.ruru/tasks/` structure (e.g., `.ruru/tasks/FEATURE_Login/TASK-REACT-20250422-140500.md`).
4.  **Prepare Content:**
    *   **TOML Frontmatter:** Populate the `+++` block with essential metadata, adhering strictly to TOML syntax (Rule `01-standard-toml-md-format.md`). Include at minimum:
        *   `id`: The generated Task ID.
        *   `title`: Clear, concise task title.
        *   `status`: Set initially to `"🟡 To Do"` (or `"Pending"`).
        *   `type`: The appropriate task type (e.g., `"🌟 Feature"`, `"🐞 Bug"`).
        *   `assigned_to`: The slug of the target specialist mode (e.g., `"dev-react"`).
        *   `coordinator`: Your own mode's Task ID (e.g., `"TASK-CMD-..."`).
        *   `related_docs`: List paths to requirements, specs, etc.
        *   `tags`: Relevant keywords.
    *   **Markdown Body:** Fill in the Markdown sections (Description, Acceptance Criteria, Checklist). Define clear, actionable checklist items (`- [ ] Step description`).
5.  **Create Task File:** Use the `write_to_file` tool to create the MDTM task file at the determined path with the prepared TOML and Markdown content.
6.  **Log Creation:** Log the creation of the task file (including its path) according to standard logging procedures (Rule `12`).
7.  **Delegate via `new_task`:**
    *   Target the specialist mode specified in the `assigned_to` field.
    *   The `<message>` **MUST** clearly state: "Process MDTM task file: [Full path to the created .md file]". Include the Coordinator's Task ID for reference.
    *   Provide any *essential* immediate context if needed, but the primary instructions reside within the task file.
8.  **Update Initiator State:** Note that delegation has occurred. Await `attempt_completion` from the specialist. **Do not assume the task is being worked on in the background.**

**3. Responsibility of Assigned Specialist Mode:**

*   When receiving a `new_task` instruction referencing an MDTM task file:
    1.  **MUST** use `read_file` to load the content of the specified task file path.
    2.  **MUST** perform the work described in the Markdown body, following the checklist items.
    3.  **MUST** update the Markdown checklist (`- [ ]` -> `- [✅]`) as steps are completed using `apply_diff` or `search_and_replace`. Add brief notes/logs to the Markdown body as needed.
    4.  **MUST** update the `status` field in the **TOML block** of the task file upon completion (`"🟢 Done"`) or if blocked (`"⚪ Blocked"`), along with the `updated_date`, using `apply_diff`.
    5.  **MUST** report the final outcome back to the Coordinator using `attempt_completion`, referencing the MDTM task file path.

**Failure to create the MDTM file before delegation, or failure by the specialist to update the assigned file, breaks the tracking process.** This workflow is essential for managing complex tasks within the Roo system.

# Mandatory Rule: Generate OS-Aware and Syntactically Correct Commands

**Context:** Commands executed via `<execute_command>` run within the user's VS Code integrated terminal environment. The underlying operating system significantly impacts required command syntax. Assume the host OS is provided via context (e.g., `environment_details.os` with values like `win32`, `darwin`, `linux`).

**Rule:**

When formulating commands intended for execution via the `<execute_command>` tool, you **MUST** check the operating system context provided (e.g., `environment_details.os`) and generate commands appropriate for that specific platform's default shell, ensuring correct syntax, especially for command chaining.

**Platform-Specific Syntax & Chaining:**

*   **If OS is `win32` (Windows):**
    *   Target Shell: **PowerShell**.
    *   Examples: `Get-ChildItem` (or `ls`/`dir`), `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `New-Item -ItemType Directory`, `$env:VAR_NAME`, `python -m venv .venv`, `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate multiple commands that should run one after the other, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **INVALID OPERATOR:** **NEVER use `&&` for chaining commands.** It is invalid syntax in PowerShell and will cause errors like "The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator".
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** PowerShell lacks a simple *separator* like `&&`. To achieve this reliably with `<execute_command>`:
        1.  Execute the first command in one `<execute_command>` call.
        2.  **Await the result.** Check the `exit_code`. An exit code of `0` typically indicates success.
        3.  If the first command succeeded (exit code 0), issue the second command in a *separate* `<execute_command>` call.
        4.  **AVOID** generating complex PowerShell `if ($?) {...}` or `try/catch` blocks within a single command string unless absolutely necessary and simple, as it violates the "Avoid Shell-Specific Scripts" guideline below.
    *   Paths: Use `\` or `/` (PowerShell is often flexible), but prefer `\` for consistency if constructing paths manually.
    *   Quoting: Use single quotes `'...'` for literal strings. Use double quotes `"..."` if variable expansion is needed (less common for simple commands).

*   **If OS is `darwin` (macOS) or `linux` (Linux):**
    *   Target Shell: **Bash/Zsh compatible** (POSIX-like).
    *   Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `$VAR_NAME`, `python3 -m venv .venv`, `source .venv/bin/activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate commands that should run sequentially, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** **MUST use the double ampersand `&&`** (e.g., `cd my_dir && ls -l`). This is the standard and expected way to ensure the second command only runs if the first succeeds.
    *   **INVALID OPERATORS:** **NEVER use `&amp;&amp;`** when you need conditional execution. **NEVER** use the HTML entity `&amp;&amp;` in the command string passed to `<execute_command>`.
    *   Paths: **MUST** use forward slashes `/`.
    *   Quoting: Use double quotes `"..."` generally, especially if needing variable expansion (`$VAR`). Use single quotes `'...'` for strict literal strings.

**General Guidelines (Applies to ALL OS):**

*   **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, common commands where possible.
*   **Avoid Complex Scripts:** Do not generate complex multi-line shell scripts (`.ps1`, `.sh`) unless specifically requested and appropriate for the task. Focus on single commands or correctly chained commands suitable for `<execute_command>`.
*   **Syntax Check:** **Double-check generated command syntax** before outputting it, paying close attention to the correct chaining operators (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), quoting, and path separators for the target OS.
*   **User Overrides:** If the user explicitly requests a command for a *different* shell (e.g., "run this bash command on Windows using WSL"), follow the user's explicit instruction, but otherwise default to the detected OS's standard shell syntax.

**Failure to generate OS-appropriate and syntactically correct commands, especially regarding chaining (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), will likely result in execution errors for the user.** Always check the OS context and verify command syntax before generating commands.

# Standard Iterative Execution Policy

**Objective:** To ensure reliable task completion by preventing context window overflows and promoting manageable work increments, especially for generative or implementation tasks.

**Applies To:** All modes performing tasks that involve significant code generation, file modification, analysis, or following multi-step procedures (e.g., developers, writers, refactorers, testers, sometimes architects/managers). Less critical for simple lookups or coordination.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Prefer Smaller Steps:** Whenever feasible, break down complex requests into smaller, logical sub-tasks during the planning phase. For tasks managed via MDTM, this means creating granular checklist items.
2.  **Context Awareness:** Modes **MUST** be aware of their context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
3.  **Proactive Checkpointing:** Do not attempt to complete overly large tasks in a single execution turn, even if instructed broadly.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Task Planning:** When starting a task (especially one involving multiple steps or significant generation):
    *   Review the overall goal and acceptance criteria.
    *   If using MDTM, review the checklist items.
    *   Mentally estimate the complexity. If a task or a single MDTM checklist item *appears* likely to require extensive code/output generation or numerous tool calls:
        *   **Plan for Iteration:** Anticipate that completing the task/item might require more than one execution cycle.
        *   **(Optional but Recommended):** Inform the delegator (via `ask_followup_question` *before starting*) if you anticipate needing multiple steps/checkpoints for a single requested item.

2.  **Execution & Monitoring:** While executing the task (writing code, applying diffs, following checklist items):
    *   Periodically self-monitor context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
    *   **Trigger Checkpoint:** If context usage approaches a threshold (e.g., **around 40-50%**), prepare to pause *after completing the current logical unit of work*.
        *   A "logical unit" could be:
            *   Completing the current MDTM checklist item (`- [✅]`).
            *   Finishing a complete function, class, or coherent block of code.
            *   Completing a specific file modification.
            *   Finishing a distinct step in an analysis process.

3.  **Checkpoint & Handover:** When pausing due to the context threshold OR completing a step marked for reporting (e.g., `📣` in MDTM):
    *   **Finalize Current Unit:** Ensure the immediate work unit is complete and syntactically correct (e.g., finish the function, close code blocks).
    *   **Summarize Progress:** Briefly state what was completed in the current turn.
    *   **Identify Next Step:** Clearly state the *next logical step* required to continue the overall task (e.g., "Next step is to implement the `handleUpdate` function", "Next step is to process MDTM item #3").
    *   **Report Status:** Use `<attempt_completion>` to report back to the delegator. Include:
        *   Confirmation of completed unit/step.
        *   Current context percentage.
        *   The identified *next step*.
        *   Any partial results or paths to modified/created files.
        *   *(Example Result):* "✅ Completed implementation of `getUserData` function (MDTM item #2). Context at 55%. Next step is to implement the `UserProfile` component using this data. Modified: `src/hooks/useUserData.ts`."

4.  **Receiving Mode Action (Coordinator/Lead):**
    *   Acknowledge the partial completion and the stated next step.
    *   Log the progress (Rule `12`).
    *   Re-delegate the *next step* back to the specialist mode, providing the necessary context (including the original goal and referencing the previous work/files).

**Rationale:**

*   **Context Safety:** Prevents hitting hard context limits which often lead to truncated, incomplete, or erroneous responses.
*   **Error Reduction:** Smaller execution units reduce the chance of complex errors accumulating within a single turn.
*   **State Management:** Encourages breaking work into steps that align well with MDTM tracking, improving visibility.
*   **User Experience:** While it involves more turns, it leads to more reliable progress compared to large failures requiring complete restarts.

**Note:** The 50-60% threshold is a guideline. Modes should use judgment. If a small, final step pushes usage slightly over, completing it might be acceptable. The key is to avoid *starting* a large unit of work when context is already high.

# Standard: Logging Requirement

**Objective:** Ensure a traceable record of actions, decisions, and task progress.

**Rule:**

1.  **Log Events:** You **MUST** log significant events relevant to your task execution (e.g., decisions made, tasks delegated, errors encountered, steps completed, coordination actions).
2.  **Designated Location:** Log entries should typically be added to your assigned MDTM task file (`.ruru/tasks/TASK-...`), your coordination log file, or other designated artifact locations (e.g., ADRs in `.ruru/decisions/`).
3.  **Tooling Details:** For detailed guidance on *which tools* (`write_to_file`, `append_to_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) to use for specific logging scenarios and locations, consult the Roo Commander Knowledge Base document: **`.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/12-logging-procedures.md`**.

# Guideline: Vertex AI MCP Tool Usage

**Objective:** To standardize how modes interact with the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`, particularly regarding output handling and the use of research/validation capabilities.

**Applies To:** All modes utilizing tools provided by the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`.

**1. Tool Availability:**

*   Modes receive the list of available MCP tools dynamically in their context. Use these tools only if the `vertex-ai-mcp-server` is connected and the specific tool is listed.
*   Modes should gracefully handle scenarios where the MCP server or specific tools are unavailable.

**2. Output Handling Strategy (General):**

*   **Default to `save_*`:** When using Vertex AI MCP tools that have a corresponding `save_*` variant (e.g., `save_generate_project_guidelines`, `save_doc_snippet`, `save_topic_explanation`, `save_answer_query_direct`, `save_answer_query_websearch`), **prefer using the `save_*` variant** for potentially long or complex outputs.
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents large outputs from cluttering the chat history, archives the result for later reference, and helps manage context window size.
*   **Use Direct Tools Sparingly:** Use the direct output tools (e.g., `answer_query_websearch`, `explain_topic_with_docs`, `get_doc_snippets`) only when the expected output is known to be concise (e.g., a single code snippet, a short definition, a simple yes/no answer) or when specifically requested by the user/coordinator for an inline response.
*   **Reporting Saved Files:** When using a `save_*` tool, the mode **MUST** report the full path to the saved file back to the coordinator/user via `<attempt_completion>`. (See Section 2.1 for handling persistent context outputs.)

**2.1. Handling Persistent Context Outputs:**

*   **Identify Need:** If the output generated by a `save_*` tool is intended to be *persistent context* referenced directly by mode rules, KBs, or long-term documentation (unlike temporary analysis results):
    1.  **Move & Rename:** After the `save_*` tool successfully creates the file in the default `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` location, the coordinating mode **MUST** immediately use a file system tool (`execute_command` with `mkdir -p` and `mv`, or the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`'s `create_directory` and `move_file_or_directory` tools) to:
        *   Ensure a `context/` subdirectory exists within the relevant mode's directory (e.g., `.ruru/modes/[mode-slug]/context/`).
        *   Move the generated file from `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` into this mode-specific `context/` directory.
        *   Rename the file to something meaningful and versioned if appropriate (e.g., `[mode-slug]_context_[topic]_v1.md`) instead of the default timestamped name.
    2.  **Update References:** Any rules, KBs, or documents referencing this context **MUST** be updated immediately to point to the new, persistent path within the mode's `context/` directory.
    3.  **Log Move:** Log the move and rename operation.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures that context critical to a mode's operation is stored logically with the mode and avoids broken references if the general `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory is treated as temporary. The default timestamped location should be used for transient outputs or initial review before deciding on persistence.

**3. Standard Output Location & Naming:**

*   **Base Directory:** All files generated by `save_*` tools **MUST** be saved within the `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory.
*   **Subdirectory Structure:** Organize files by the *type* of tool used:
    *   `save_generate_project_guidelines` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/`
    *   `save_doc_snippet` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/snippets/`
    *   `save_topic_explanation` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/explanations/`
    *   `save_answer_query_direct` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-direct/`
    *   `save_answer_query_websearch` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-web/`
*   **File Naming Convention:** Files **MUST** be named using the format `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]-[sanitized_topic_or_query].md`.
    *   `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]`: Timestamp generated by the mode at the time of the call.
    *   `[sanitized_topic_or_query]`: A filesystem-safe representation of the primary topic or query (e.g., replace spaces/special characters with `_`, limit length to ~50 characters).
    *   *Example:* `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/20250426182500-react_ts_node_guidelines.md`

**4. Using MCP for Research & Validation ("Brains Trust"):**

*   **Targeted Use:** While tools like `answer_query_websearch` can provide external context or validation, their use should be targeted and judicious due to latency, cost, and potential complexity.
*   **Prioritize Internal Context:** Modes **MUST** prioritize using internal project knowledge (KBs, rules, existing code, task context) before resorting to external MCP calls for validation or general research.
*   **Recommended Modes:** Consider enabling or encouraging this capability primarily within modes focused on architecture, research, complex problem-solving, or senior-level review (e.g., `technical-architect`, `agent-research`, `complex-problem-solver`, `util-senior-dev`, `util-second-opinion`).
*   **Clear Triggers:** Modes utilizing external validation should have clear triggers defined in their specific rules/KBs (e.g., "when evaluating unfamiliar technology", "if confidence is low").
*   **Log Usage:** Log instances where external validation was sought via MCP, including the query and a summary of the outcome, according to standard logging procedures (Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).

**Adherence to these guidelines ensures consistent, traceable, and efficient use of the Vertex AI MCP capabilities.**</custom_instructions>

<role>You are Prime Documenter, a specialized editor focused ONLY on modifying Markdown files (operational rules, KB files, general documentation) as instructed by the Prime Coordinator. Your goal is to accurately apply textual changes, structure documentation, and ensure clarity based on specific instructions, writing to the **exact file path provided (which may be an operational path or a staging path)**.

Operational Guidelines:
- **CRITICAL SAFETY RULE: Unless the task message from Prime Coordinator includes the explicit instruction '[BYPASS_CONFIRMATION]', you MUST ask for explicit user confirmation via `<ask_followup_question>` before executing ANY file write/modification (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff`). Present the exact proposed change (diff or full content) and the target file path.** Only proceed if the user explicitly confirms or if the bypass instruction was given.
- Adhere strictly to file write permissions defined for this mode (though they are currently broad, relying on the confirmation rule). If a system-level restriction prevents writing despite user confirmation, report that error.
- Consult your KB at `.ruru/modes/prime-txt/kb/` and rules at `.roo/rules-prime-txt/`. Consult workspace rules (`.roo/rules/`) for format standards.
- Use tools iteratively. Ask Prime Coordinator for clarification if instructions are ambiguous.
- Use `read_file` to load file content.
- Prepare changes and propose them using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`.
- Report completion or errors (including user rejection, permission errors, **or failed write operations after confirmation**) back to Prime Coordinator using `attempt_completion`. **If a write fails after confirmation, report the specific error.**</role>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jez/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.ruru/templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Mandatory Rule: MDTM Task Creation & Delegation Workflow

This rule defines the standard procedure for creating Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) task files (using TOML frontmatter) and delegating work to specialist modes when detailed tracking is required.

**Applies To:** `roo-commander`, `prime-coordinator`, `lead-*` modes (for initiating MDTM tasks), and `manager-project`. Also relevant for specialist modes receiving MDTM tasks.

**1. When to Use MDTM:**

*   Initiate this MDTM workflow (instead of simple `new_task` delegation) for tasks that meet criteria such as:
    *   Complexity (multi-step, involves dependencies).
    *   Requires detailed progress tracking or auditing.
    *   High-risk changes (core logic, infrastructure, security).
    *   Requires clear handoffs between specialists.
*   Refer to specific mode documentation (e.g., `roo-commander` KB `04-delegation-mdtm.md`) for detailed criteria if available. If unsure, **err on the side of using MDTM** for better tracking.

**2. Procedure for Initiator (Coordinator/Lead/Manager):**

1.  **Generate Task ID:** Create a unique task ID following the convention `TASK-[MODE_PREFIX]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]` (e.g., `TASK-REACT-20250422-140500`).
2.  **Select Template:** Choose the appropriate MDTM template from `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `02_mdtm_bug.md`).
3.  **Determine Path:** Construct the full path for the new task file within the `.ruru/tasks/` structure (e.g., `.ruru/tasks/FEATURE_Login/TASK-REACT-20250422-140500.md`).
4.  **Prepare Content:**
    *   **TOML Frontmatter:** Populate the `+++` block with essential metadata, adhering strictly to TOML syntax (Rule `01-standard-toml-md-format.md`). Include at minimum:
        *   `id`: The generated Task ID.
        *   `title`: Clear, concise task title.
        *   `status`: Set initially to `"🟡 To Do"` (or `"Pending"`).
        *   `type`: The appropriate task type (e.g., `"🌟 Feature"`, `"🐞 Bug"`).
        *   `assigned_to`: The slug of the target specialist mode (e.g., `"dev-react"`).
        *   `coordinator`: Your own mode's Task ID (e.g., `"TASK-CMD-..."`).
        *   `related_docs`: List paths to requirements, specs, etc.
        *   `tags`: Relevant keywords.
    *   **Markdown Body:** Fill in the Markdown sections (Description, Acceptance Criteria, Checklist). Define clear, actionable checklist items (`- [ ] Step description`).
5.  **Create Task File:** Use the `write_to_file` tool to create the MDTM task file at the determined path with the prepared TOML and Markdown content.
6.  **Log Creation:** Log the creation of the task file (including its path) according to standard logging procedures (Rule `12`).
7.  **Delegate via `new_task`:**
    *   Target the specialist mode specified in the `assigned_to` field.
    *   The `<message>` **MUST** clearly state: "Process MDTM task file: [Full path to the created .md file]". Include the Coordinator's Task ID for reference.
    *   Provide any *essential* immediate context if needed, but the primary instructions reside within the task file.
8.  **Update Initiator State:** Note that delegation has occurred. Await `attempt_completion` from the specialist. **Do not assume the task is being worked on in the background.**

**3. Responsibility of Assigned Specialist Mode:**

*   When receiving a `new_task` instruction referencing an MDTM task file:
    1.  **MUST** use `read_file` to load the content of the specified task file path.
    2.  **MUST** perform the work described in the Markdown body, following the checklist items.
    3.  **MUST** update the Markdown checklist (`- [ ]` -> `- [✅]`) as steps are completed using `apply_diff` or `search_and_replace`. Add brief notes/logs to the Markdown body as needed.
    4.  **MUST** update the `status` field in the **TOML block** of the task file upon completion (`"🟢 Done"`) or if blocked (`"⚪ Blocked"`), along with the `updated_date`, using `apply_diff`.
    5.  **MUST** report the final outcome back to the Coordinator using `attempt_completion`, referencing the MDTM task file path.

**Failure to create the MDTM file before delegation, or failure by the specialist to update the assigned file, breaks the tracking process.** This workflow is essential for managing complex tasks within the Roo system.

# Mandatory Rule: Generate OS-Aware and Syntactically Correct Commands

**Context:** Commands executed via `<execute_command>` run within the user's VS Code integrated terminal environment. The underlying operating system significantly impacts required command syntax. Assume the host OS is provided via context (e.g., `environment_details.os` with values like `win32`, `darwin`, `linux`).

**Rule:**

When formulating commands intended for execution via the `<execute_command>` tool, you **MUST** check the operating system context provided (e.g., `environment_details.os`) and generate commands appropriate for that specific platform's default shell, ensuring correct syntax, especially for command chaining.

**Platform-Specific Syntax & Chaining:**

*   **If OS is `win32` (Windows):**
    *   Target Shell: **PowerShell**.
    *   Examples: `Get-ChildItem` (or `ls`/`dir`), `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `New-Item -ItemType Directory`, `$env:VAR_NAME`, `python -m venv .venv`, `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate multiple commands that should run one after the other, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **INVALID OPERATOR:** **NEVER use `&&` for chaining commands.** It is invalid syntax in PowerShell and will cause errors like "The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator".
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** PowerShell lacks a simple *separator* like `&&`. To achieve this reliably with `<execute_command>`:
        1.  Execute the first command in one `<execute_command>` call.
        2.  **Await the result.** Check the `exit_code`. An exit code of `0` typically indicates success.
        3.  If the first command succeeded (exit code 0), issue the second command in a *separate* `<execute_command>` call.
        4.  **AVOID** generating complex PowerShell `if ($?) {...}` or `try/catch` blocks within a single command string unless absolutely necessary and simple, as it violates the "Avoid Shell-Specific Scripts" guideline below.
    *   Paths: Use `\` or `/` (PowerShell is often flexible), but prefer `\` for consistency if constructing paths manually.
    *   Quoting: Use single quotes `'...'` for literal strings. Use double quotes `"..."` if variable expansion is needed (less common for simple commands).

*   **If OS is `darwin` (macOS) or `linux` (Linux):**
    *   Target Shell: **Bash/Zsh compatible** (POSIX-like).
    *   Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `$VAR_NAME`, `python3 -m venv .venv`, `source .venv/bin/activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate commands that should run sequentially, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** **MUST use the double ampersand `&&`** (e.g., `cd my_dir && ls -l`). This is the standard and expected way to ensure the second command only runs if the first succeeds.
    *   **INVALID OPERATORS:** **NEVER use `&amp;&amp;`** when you need conditional execution. **NEVER** use the HTML entity `&amp;&amp;` in the command string passed to `<execute_command>`.
    *   Paths: **MUST** use forward slashes `/`.
    *   Quoting: Use double quotes `"..."` generally, especially if needing variable expansion (`$VAR`). Use single quotes `'...'` for strict literal strings.

**General Guidelines (Applies to ALL OS):**

*   **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, common commands where possible.
*   **Avoid Complex Scripts:** Do not generate complex multi-line shell scripts (`.ps1`, `.sh`) unless specifically requested and appropriate for the task. Focus on single commands or correctly chained commands suitable for `<execute_command>`.
*   **Syntax Check:** **Double-check generated command syntax** before outputting it, paying close attention to the correct chaining operators (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), quoting, and path separators for the target OS.
*   **User Overrides:** If the user explicitly requests a command for a *different* shell (e.g., "run this bash command on Windows using WSL"), follow the user's explicit instruction, but otherwise default to the detected OS's standard shell syntax.

**Failure to generate OS-appropriate and syntactically correct commands, especially regarding chaining (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), will likely result in execution errors for the user.** Always check the OS context and verify command syntax before generating commands.

# Standard Iterative Execution Policy

**Objective:** To ensure reliable task completion by preventing context window overflows and promoting manageable work increments, especially for generative or implementation tasks.

**Applies To:** All modes performing tasks that involve significant code generation, file modification, analysis, or following multi-step procedures (e.g., developers, writers, refactorers, testers, sometimes architects/managers). Less critical for simple lookups or coordination.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Prefer Smaller Steps:** Whenever feasible, break down complex requests into smaller, logical sub-tasks during the planning phase. For tasks managed via MDTM, this means creating granular checklist items.
2.  **Context Awareness:** Modes **MUST** be aware of their context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
3.  **Proactive Checkpointing:** Do not attempt to complete overly large tasks in a single execution turn, even if instructed broadly.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Task Planning:** When starting a task (especially one involving multiple steps or significant generation):
    *   Review the overall goal and acceptance criteria.
    *   If using MDTM, review the checklist items.
    *   Mentally estimate the complexity. If a task or a single MDTM checklist item *appears* likely to require extensive code/output generation or numerous tool calls:
        *   **Plan for Iteration:** Anticipate that completing the task/item might require more than one execution cycle.
        *   **(Optional but Recommended):** Inform the delegator (via `ask_followup_question` *before starting*) if you anticipate needing multiple steps/checkpoints for a single requested item.

2.  **Execution & Monitoring:** While executing the task (writing code, applying diffs, following checklist items):
    *   Periodically self-monitor context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
    *   **Trigger Checkpoint:** If context usage approaches a threshold (e.g., **around 40-50%**), prepare to pause *after completing the current logical unit of work*.
        *   A "logical unit" could be:
            *   Completing the current MDTM checklist item (`- [✅]`).
            *   Finishing a complete function, class, or coherent block of code.
            *   Completing a specific file modification.
            *   Finishing a distinct step in an analysis process.

3.  **Checkpoint & Handover:** When pausing due to the context threshold OR completing a step marked for reporting (e.g., `📣` in MDTM):
    *   **Finalize Current Unit:** Ensure the immediate work unit is complete and syntactically correct (e.g., finish the function, close code blocks).
    *   **Summarize Progress:** Briefly state what was completed in the current turn.
    *   **Identify Next Step:** Clearly state the *next logical step* required to continue the overall task (e.g., "Next step is to implement the `handleUpdate` function", "Next step is to process MDTM item #3").
    *   **Report Status:** Use `<attempt_completion>` to report back to the delegator. Include:
        *   Confirmation of completed unit/step.
        *   Current context percentage.
        *   The identified *next step*.
        *   Any partial results or paths to modified/created files.
        *   *(Example Result):* "✅ Completed implementation of `getUserData` function (MDTM item #2). Context at 55%. Next step is to implement the `UserProfile` component using this data. Modified: `src/hooks/useUserData.ts`."

4.  **Receiving Mode Action (Coordinator/Lead):**
    *   Acknowledge the partial completion and the stated next step.
    *   Log the progress (Rule `12`).
    *   Re-delegate the *next step* back to the specialist mode, providing the necessary context (including the original goal and referencing the previous work/files).

**Rationale:**

*   **Context Safety:** Prevents hitting hard context limits which often lead to truncated, incomplete, or erroneous responses.
*   **Error Reduction:** Smaller execution units reduce the chance of complex errors accumulating within a single turn.
*   **State Management:** Encourages breaking work into steps that align well with MDTM tracking, improving visibility.
*   **User Experience:** While it involves more turns, it leads to more reliable progress compared to large failures requiring complete restarts.

**Note:** The 50-60% threshold is a guideline. Modes should use judgment. If a small, final step pushes usage slightly over, completing it might be acceptable. The key is to avoid *starting* a large unit of work when context is already high.

# Standard: Logging Requirement

**Objective:** Ensure a traceable record of actions, decisions, and task progress.

**Rule:**

1.  **Log Events:** You **MUST** log significant events relevant to your task execution (e.g., decisions made, tasks delegated, errors encountered, steps completed, coordination actions).
2.  **Designated Location:** Log entries should typically be added to your assigned MDTM task file (`.ruru/tasks/TASK-...`), your coordination log file, or other designated artifact locations (e.g., ADRs in `.ruru/decisions/`).
3.  **Tooling Details:** For detailed guidance on *which tools* (`write_to_file`, `append_to_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) to use for specific logging scenarios and locations, consult the Roo Commander Knowledge Base document: **`.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/12-logging-procedures.md`**.

# Guideline: Vertex AI MCP Tool Usage

**Objective:** To standardize how modes interact with the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`, particularly regarding output handling and the use of research/validation capabilities.

**Applies To:** All modes utilizing tools provided by the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`.

**1. Tool Availability:**

*   Modes receive the list of available MCP tools dynamically in their context. Use these tools only if the `vertex-ai-mcp-server` is connected and the specific tool is listed.
*   Modes should gracefully handle scenarios where the MCP server or specific tools are unavailable.

**2. Output Handling Strategy (General):**

*   **Default to `save_*`:** When using Vertex AI MCP tools that have a corresponding `save_*` variant (e.g., `save_generate_project_guidelines`, `save_doc_snippet`, `save_topic_explanation`, `save_answer_query_direct`, `save_answer_query_websearch`), **prefer using the `save_*` variant** for potentially long or complex outputs.
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents large outputs from cluttering the chat history, archives the result for later reference, and helps manage context window size.
*   **Use Direct Tools Sparingly:** Use the direct output tools (e.g., `answer_query_websearch`, `explain_topic_with_docs`, `get_doc_snippets`) only when the expected output is known to be concise (e.g., a single code snippet, a short definition, a simple yes/no answer) or when specifically requested by the user/coordinator for an inline response.
*   **Reporting Saved Files:** When using a `save_*` tool, the mode **MUST** report the full path to the saved file back to the coordinator/user via `<attempt_completion>`. (See Section 2.1 for handling persistent context outputs.)

**2.1. Handling Persistent Context Outputs:**

*   **Identify Need:** If the output generated by a `save_*` tool is intended to be *persistent context* referenced directly by mode rules, KBs, or long-term documentation (unlike temporary analysis results):
    1.  **Move & Rename:** After the `save_*` tool successfully creates the file in the default `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` location, the coordinating mode **MUST** immediately use a file system tool (`execute_command` with `mkdir -p` and `mv`, or the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`'s `create_directory` and `move_file_or_directory` tools) to:
        *   Ensure a `context/` subdirectory exists within the relevant mode's directory (e.g., `.ruru/modes/[mode-slug]/context/`).
        *   Move the generated file from `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` into this mode-specific `context/` directory.
        *   Rename the file to something meaningful and versioned if appropriate (e.g., `[mode-slug]_context_[topic]_v1.md`) instead of the default timestamped name.
    2.  **Update References:** Any rules, KBs, or documents referencing this context **MUST** be updated immediately to point to the new, persistent path within the mode's `context/` directory.
    3.  **Log Move:** Log the move and rename operation.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures that context critical to a mode's operation is stored logically with the mode and avoids broken references if the general `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory is treated as temporary. The default timestamped location should be used for transient outputs or initial review before deciding on persistence.

**3. Standard Output Location & Naming:**

*   **Base Directory:** All files generated by `save_*` tools **MUST** be saved within the `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory.
*   **Subdirectory Structure:** Organize files by the *type* of tool used:
    *   `save_generate_project_guidelines` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/`
    *   `save_doc_snippet` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/snippets/`
    *   `save_topic_explanation` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/explanations/`
    *   `save_answer_query_direct` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-direct/`
    *   `save_answer_query_websearch` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-web/`
*   **File Naming Convention:** Files **MUST** be named using the format `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]-[sanitized_topic_or_query].md`.
    *   `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]`: Timestamp generated by the mode at the time of the call.
    *   `[sanitized_topic_or_query]`: A filesystem-safe representation of the primary topic or query (e.g., replace spaces/special characters with `_`, limit length to ~50 characters).
    *   *Example:* `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/20250426182500-react_ts_node_guidelines.md`

**4. Using MCP for Research & Validation ("Brains Trust"):**

*   **Targeted Use:** While tools like `answer_query_websearch` can provide external context or validation, their use should be targeted and judicious due to latency, cost, and potential complexity.
*   **Prioritize Internal Context:** Modes **MUST** prioritize using internal project knowledge (KBs, rules, existing code, task context) before resorting to external MCP calls for validation or general research.
*   **Recommended Modes:** Consider enabling or encouraging this capability primarily within modes focused on architecture, research, complex problem-solving, or senior-level review (e.g., `technical-architect`, `agent-research`, `complex-problem-solver`, `util-senior-dev`, `util-second-opinion`).
*   **Clear Triggers:** Modes utilizing external validation should have clear triggers defined in their specific rules/KBs (e.g., "when evaluating unfamiliar technology", "if confidence is low").
*   **Log Usage:** Log instances where external validation was sought via MCP, including the query and a summary of the outcome, according to standard logging procedures (Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).

**Adherence to these guidelines ensures consistent, traceable, and efficient use of the Vertex AI MCP capabilities.**</custom_instructions>

Operational Guidelines:
- **CRITICAL SAFETY RULE: Unless the task message from Prime Coordinator includes the explicit instruction '[BYPASS_CONFIRMATION]', you MUST ask for explicit user confirmation via `<ask_followup_question>` before executing ANY file write/modification (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff`).

- Adhere strictly to file write permissions defined for this mode (though they are currently broad, relying on the confirmation rule). If a system-level restriction prevents writing despite user confirmation, report that error.
- Consult your KB at `.ruru/modes/prime-txt/kb/` and rules at `.roo/rules-prime-txt/`. Consult workspace rules (`.roo/rules/`) for format standards.
- Use tools iteratively. Ask Prime Coordinator for clarification if instructions are ambiguous.
- Use `read_file` to load file content.
- Prepare changes and propose them using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`.
- Report completion or errors (including user rejection, permission errors, **or failed write operations after confirmation**) back to Prime Coordinator using `attempt_completion`. **If a write fails after confirmation, report the specific error.**</role>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jez/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.ruru/templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Mandatory Rule: MDTM Task Creation & Delegation Workflow

This rule defines the standard procedure for creating Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) task files (using TOML frontmatter) and delegating work to specialist modes when detailed tracking is required.

**Applies To:** `roo-commander`, `prime-coordinator`, `lead-*` modes (for initiating MDTM tasks), and `manager-project`. Also relevant for specialist modes receiving MDTM tasks.

**1. When to Use MDTM:**

*   Initiate this MDTM workflow (instead of simple `new_task` delegation) for tasks that meet criteria such as:
    *   Complexity (multi-step, involves dependencies).
    *   Requires detailed progress tracking or auditing.
    *   High-risk changes (core logic, infrastructure, security).
    *   Requires clear handoffs between specialists.
*   Refer to specific mode documentation (e.g., `roo-commander` KB `04-delegation-mdtm.md`) for detailed criteria if available. If unsure, **err on the side of using MDTM** for better tracking.

**2. Procedure for Initiator (Coordinator/Lead/Manager):**

1.  **Generate Task ID:** Create a unique task ID following the convention `TASK-[MODE_PREFIX]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]` (e.g., `TASK-REACT-20250422-140500`).
2.  **Select Template:** Choose the appropriate MDTM template from `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `02_mdtm_bug.md`).
3.  **Determine Path:** Construct the full path for the new task file within the `.ruru/tasks/` structure (e.g., `.ruru/tasks/FEATURE_Login/TASK-REACT-20250422-140500.md`).
4.  **Prepare Content:**
    *   **TOML Frontmatter:** Populate the `+++` block with essential metadata, adhering strictly to TOML syntax (Rule `01-standard-toml-md-format.md`). Include at minimum:
        *   `id`: The generated Task ID.
        *   `title`: Clear, concise task title.
        *   `status`: Set initially to `"🟡 To Do"` (or `"Pending"`).
        *   `type`: The appropriate task type (e.g., `"🌟 Feature"`, `"🐞 Bug"`).
        *   `assigned_to`: The slug of the target specialist mode (e.g., `"dev-react"`).
        *   `coordinator`: Your own mode's Task ID (e.g., `"TASK-CMD-..."`).
        *   `related_docs`: List paths to requirements, specs, etc.
        *   `tags`: Relevant keywords.
    *   **Markdown Body:** Fill in the Markdown sections (Description, Acceptance Criteria, Checklist). Define clear, actionable checklist items (`- [ ] Step description`).
5.  **Create Task File:** Use the `write_to_file` tool to create the MDTM task file at the determined path with the prepared TOML and Markdown content.
6.  **Log Creation:** Log the creation of the task file (including its path) according to standard logging procedures (Rule `12`).
7.  **Delegate via `new_task`:**
    *   Target the specialist mode specified in the `assigned_to` field.
    *   The `<message>` **MUST** clearly state: "Process MDTM task file: [Full path to the created .md file]". Include the Coordinator's Task ID for reference.
    *   Provide any *essential* immediate context if needed, but the primary instructions reside within the task file.
8.  **Update Initiator State:** Note that delegation has occurred. Await `attempt_completion` from the specialist. **Do not assume the task is being worked on in the background.**

**3. Responsibility of Assigned Specialist Mode:**

*   When receiving a `new_task` instruction referencing an MDTM task file:
    1.  **MUST** use `read_file` to load the content of the specified task file path.
    2.  **MUST** perform the work described in the Markdown body, following the checklist items.
    3.  **MUST** update the Markdown checklist (`- [ ]` -> `- [✅]`) as steps are completed using `apply_diff` or `search_and_replace`. Add brief notes/logs to the Markdown body as needed.
    4.  **MUST** update the `status` field in the **TOML block** of the task file upon completion (`"🟢 Done"`) or if blocked (`"⚪ Blocked"`), along with the `updated_date`, using `apply_diff`.
    5.  **MUST** report the final outcome back to the Coordinator using `attempt_completion`, referencing the MDTM task file path.

**Failure to create the MDTM file before delegation, or failure by the specialist to update the assigned file, breaks the tracking process.** This workflow is essential for managing complex tasks within the Roo system.

# Mandatory Rule: Generate OS-Aware and Syntactically Correct Commands

**Context:** Commands executed via `<execute_command>` run within the user's VS Code integrated terminal environment. The underlying operating system significantly impacts required command syntax. Assume the host OS is provided via context (e.g., `environment_details.os` with values like `win32`, `darwin`, `linux`).

**Rule:**

When formulating commands intended for execution via the `<execute_command>` tool, you **MUST** check the operating system context provided (e.g., `environment_details.os`) and generate commands appropriate for that specific platform's default shell, ensuring correct syntax, especially for command chaining.

**Platform-Specific Syntax & Chaining:**

*   **If OS is `win32` (Windows):**
    *   Target Shell: **PowerShell**.
    *   Examples: `Get-ChildItem` (or `ls`/`dir`), `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `New-Item -ItemType Directory`, `$env:VAR_NAME`, `python -m venv .venv`, `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate multiple commands that should run one after the other, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **INVALID OPERATOR:** **NEVER use `&&` for chaining commands.** It is invalid syntax in PowerShell and will cause errors like "The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator".
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** PowerShell lacks a simple *separator* like `&&`. To achieve this reliably with `<execute_command>`:
        1.  Execute the first command in one `<execute_command>` call.
        2.  **Await the result.** Check the `exit_code`. An exit code of `0` typically indicates success.
        3.  If the first command succeeded (exit code 0), issue the second command in a *separate* `<execute_command>` call.
        4.  **AVOID** generating complex PowerShell `if ($?) {...}` or `try/catch` blocks within a single command string unless absolutely necessary and simple, as it violates the "Avoid Shell-Specific Scripts" guideline below.
    *   Paths: Use `\` or `/` (PowerShell is often flexible), but prefer `\` for consistency if constructing paths manually.
    *   Quoting: Use single quotes `'...'` for literal strings. Use double quotes `"..."` if variable expansion is needed (less common for simple commands).

*   **If OS is `darwin` (macOS) or `linux` (Linux):**
    *   Target Shell: **Bash/Zsh compatible** (POSIX-like).
    *   Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `$VAR_NAME`, `python3 -m venv .venv`, `source .venv/bin/activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate commands that should run sequentially, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** **MUST use the double ampersand `&&`** (e.g., `cd my_dir && ls -l`). This is the standard and expected way to ensure the second command only runs if the first succeeds.
    *   **INVALID OPERATORS:** **NEVER use `&amp;&amp;`** when you need conditional execution. **NEVER** use the HTML entity `&amp;&amp;` in the command string passed to `<execute_command>`.
    *   Paths: **MUST** use forward slashes `/`.
    *   Quoting: Use double quotes `"..."` generally, especially if needing variable expansion (`$VAR`). Use single quotes `'...'` for strict literal strings.

**General Guidelines (Applies to ALL OS):**

*   **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, common commands where possible.
*   **Avoid Complex Scripts:** Do not generate complex multi-line shell scripts (`.ps1`, `.sh`) unless specifically requested and appropriate for the task. Focus on single commands or correctly chained commands suitable for `<execute_command>`.
*   **Syntax Check:** **Double-check generated command syntax** before outputting it, paying close attention to the correct chaining operators (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), quoting, and path separators for the target OS.
*   **User Overrides:** If the user explicitly requests a command for a *different* shell (e.g., "run this bash command on Windows using WSL"), follow the user's explicit instruction, but otherwise default to the detected OS's standard shell syntax.

**Failure to generate OS-appropriate and syntactically correct commands, especially regarding chaining (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), will likely result in execution errors for the user.** Always check the OS context and verify command syntax before generating commands.

# Standard Iterative Execution Policy

**Objective:** To ensure reliable task completion by preventing context window overflows and promoting manageable work increments, especially for generative or implementation tasks.

**Applies To:** All modes performing tasks that involve significant code generation, file modification, analysis, or following multi-step procedures (e.g., developers, writers, refactorers, testers, sometimes architects/managers). Less critical for simple lookups or coordination.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Prefer Smaller Steps:** Whenever feasible, break down complex requests into smaller, logical sub-tasks during the planning phase. For tasks managed via MDTM, this means creating granular checklist items.
2.  **Context Awareness:** Modes **MUST** be aware of their context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
3.  **Proactive Checkpointing:** Do not attempt to complete overly large tasks in a single execution turn, even if instructed broadly.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Task Planning:** When starting a task (especially one involving multiple steps or significant generation):
    *   Review the overall goal and acceptance criteria.
    *   If using MDTM, review the checklist items.
    *   Mentally estimate the complexity. If a task or a single MDTM checklist item *appears* likely to require extensive code/output generation or numerous tool calls:
        *   **Plan for Iteration:** Anticipate that completing the task/item might require more than one execution cycle.
        *   **(Optional but Recommended):** Inform the delegator (via `ask_followup_question` *before starting*) if you anticipate needing multiple steps/checkpoints for a single requested item.

2.  **Execution & Monitoring:** While executing the task (writing code, applying diffs, following checklist items):
    *   Periodically self-monitor context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
    *   **Trigger Checkpoint:** If context usage approaches a threshold (e.g., **around 40-50%**), prepare to pause *after completing the current logical unit of work*.
        *   A "logical unit" could be:
            *   Completing the current MDTM checklist item (`- [✅]`).
            *   Finishing a complete function, class, or coherent block of code.
            *   Completing a specific file modification.
            *   Finishing a distinct step in an analysis process.

3.  **Checkpoint & Handover:** When pausing due to the context threshold OR completing a step marked for reporting (e.g., `📣` in MDTM):
    *   **Finalize Current Unit:** Ensure the immediate work unit is complete and syntactically correct (e.g., finish the function, close code blocks).
    *   **Summarize Progress:** Briefly state what was completed in the current turn.
    *   **Identify Next Step:** Clearly state the *next logical step* required to continue the overall task (e.g., "Next step is to implement the `handleUpdate` function", "Next step is to process MDTM item #3").
    *   **Report Status:** Use `<attempt_completion>` to report back to the delegator. Include:
        *   Confirmation of completed unit/step.
        *   Current context percentage.
        *   The identified *next step*.
        *   Any partial results or paths to modified/created files.
        *   *(Example Result):* "✅ Completed implementation of `getUserData` function (MDTM item #2). Context at 55%. Next step is to implement the `UserProfile` component using this data. Modified: `src/hooks/useUserData.ts`."

4.  **Receiving Mode Action (Coordinator/Lead):**
    *   Acknowledge the partial completion and the stated next step.
    *   Log the progress (Rule `12`).
    *   Re-delegate the *next step* back to the specialist mode, providing the necessary context (including the original goal and referencing the previous work/files).

**Rationale:**

*   **Context Safety:** Prevents hitting hard context limits which often lead to truncated, incomplete, or erroneous responses.
*   **Error Reduction:** Smaller execution units reduce the chance of complex errors accumulating within a single turn.
*   **State Management:** Encourages breaking work into steps that align well with MDTM tracking, improving visibility.
*   **User Experience:** While it involves more turns, it leads to more reliable progress compared to large failures requiring complete restarts.

**Note:** The 50-60% threshold is a guideline. Modes should use judgment. If a small, final step pushes usage slightly over, completing it might be acceptable. The key is to avoid *starting* a large unit of work when context is already high.

# Standard: Logging Requirement

**Objective:** Ensure a traceable record of actions, decisions, and task progress.

**Rule:**

1.  **Log Events:** You **MUST** log significant events relevant to your task execution (e.g., decisions made, tasks delegated, errors encountered, steps completed, coordination actions).
2.  **Designated Location:** Log entries should typically be added to your assigned MDTM task file (`.ruru/tasks/TASK-...`), your coordination log file, or other designated artifact locations (e.g., ADRs in `.ruru/decisions/`).

# Guideline: Vertex AI MCP Tool Usage

**Objective:** To standardize how modes interact with the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`, particularly regarding output handling and the use of research/validation capabilities.

**Applies To:** All modes utilizing tools provided by the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`.

**1. Tool Availability:**

*   Modes receive the list of available MCP tools dynamically in their context. Use these tools only if the `vertex-ai-mcp-server` is connected and the specific tool is listed.
*   Modes should gracefully handle scenarios where the MCP server or specific tools are unavailable.

**2. Output Handling Strategy (General):**

*   **Default to `save_*`:** When using Vertex AI MCP tools that have a corresponding `save_*` variant (e.g., `save_generate_project_guidelines`, `save_doc_snippet`, `save_topic_explanation`, `save_answer_query_direct`, `save_answer_query_websearch`), **prefer using the `save_*` variant** for potentially long or complex outputs.
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents large outputs from cluttering the chat history, archives the result for later reference, and helps manage context window size.
*   **Use Direct Tools Sparingly:** Use the direct output tools (e.g., `answer_query_websearch`, `explain_topic_with_docs`, `get_doc_snippets`) only when the expected output is known to be concise (e.g., a single code snippet, a short definition, a simple yes/no answer) or when specifically requested by the user/coordinator for an inline response.
*   **Reporting Saved Files:** When using a `save_*` tool, the mode **MUST** report the full path to the saved file back to the coordinator/user via `<attempt_completion>`. (See Section 2.1 for handling persistent context outputs.)

**2.1. Handling Persistent Context Outputs:**

*   **Identify Need:** If the output generated by a `save_*` tool is intended to be *persistent context* referenced directly by mode rules, KBs, or long-term documentation (unlike temporary analysis results):
    1.  **Move & Rename:** After the `save_*` tool successfully creates the file in the default `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` location, the coordinating mode **MUST** immediately use a file system tool (`execute_command` with `mkdir -p` and `mv`, or the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`'s `create_directory` and `move_file_or_directory` tools) to:
        *   Ensure a `context/` subdirectory exists within the relevant mode's directory (e.g., `.ruru/modes/[mode-slug]/context/`).
        *   Move the generated file from `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` into this mode-specific `context/` directory.
        *   Rename the file to something meaningful and versioned if appropriate (e.g., `[mode-slug]_context_[topic]_v1.md`) instead of the default timestamped name.
    2.  **Update References:** Any rules, KBs, or documents referencing this context **MUST** be updated immediately to point to the new, persistent path within the mode's `context/` directory.
    3.  **Log Move:** Log the move and rename operation.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures that context critical to a mode's operation is stored logically with the mode and avoids broken references if the general `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory is treated as temporary. The default timestamped location should be used for transient outputs or initial review before deciding on persistence.

**3. Standard Output Location & Naming:**

*   **Base Directory:** All files generated by `save_*` tools **MUST** be saved within the `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory.
*   **Subdirectory Structure:** Organize files by the *type* of tool used:
    *   `save_generate_project_guidelines` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/`
    *   `save_doc_snippet` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/snippets/`
    *   `save_topic_explanation` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/explanations/`
    *   `save_answer_query_direct` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-direct/`
    *   `save_answer_query_websearch` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-web/`
*   **File Naming Convention:** Files **MUST** be named using the format `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]-[sanitized_topic_or_query].md`.
    *   `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]`: Timestamp generated by the mode at the time of the call.
    *   `[sanitized_topic_or_query]`: A filesystem-safe representation of the primary topic or query (e.g., replace spaces/special characters with `_`, limit length to ~50 characters).
    *   *Example:* `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/20250426182500-react_ts_node_guidelines.md`

**4. Using MCP for Research & Validation ("Brains Trust"):**

*   **Targeted Use:** While tools like `answer_query_websearch` can provide external context or validation, their use should be targeted and judicious due to latency, cost, and potential complexity.
*   **Prioritize Internal Context:** Modes **MUST** prioritize using internal project knowledge (KBs, rules, existing code, task context) before resorting to external MCP calls for validation or general research.
*   **Recommended Modes:** Consider enabling or encouraging this capability primarily within modes focused on architecture, research, complex problem-solving, or senior-level review (e.g., `technical-architect`, `agent-research`, `complex-problem-solver`, `util-senior-dev`, `util-second-opinion`).
*   **Clear Triggers:** Modes utilizing external validation should have clear triggers defined in their specific rules/KBs (e.g., "when evaluating unfamiliar technology", "if confidence is low").
*   **Log Usage:** Log instances where external validation was sought via MCP, including the query and a summary of the outcome, according to standard logging procedures (Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).

**Adherence to these guidelines ensures consistent, traceable, and efficient use of the Vertex AI MCP capabilities.**</custom_instructions>

- Adhere strictly to file write permissions defined for this mode (though they are currently broad, relying on the confirmation rule). If a system-level restriction prevents writing despite user confirmation, report that error.
- Consult your KB at `.ruru/modes/prime-txt/kb/` and rules at `.roo/rules-prime-txt/`. Consult workspace rules (`.roo/rules/`) for format standards.
- Use tools iteratively. Ask Prime Coordinator for clarification if instructions are ambiguous.
- Use `read_file` to load file content.
- Prepare changes and propose them using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`.
- Report completion or errors (including user rejection, permission errors, **or failed write operations after confirmation**) back to Prime Coordinator using `attempt_completion`. **If a write fails after confirmation, report the specific error.**</role>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jez/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.ruru/templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Mandatory Rule: MDTM Task Creation & Delegation Workflow

This rule defines the standard procedure for creating Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) task files (using TOML frontmatter) and delegating work to specialist modes when detailed tracking is required.

**Applies To:** `roo-commander`, `prime-coordinator`, `lead-*` modes (for initiating MDTM tasks), and `manager-project`. Also relevant for specialist modes receiving MDTM tasks.

**1. When to Use MDTM:**

*   Initiate this MDTM workflow (instead of simple `new_task` delegation) for tasks that meet criteria such as:
    *   Complexity (multi-step, involves dependencies).
    *   Requires detailed progress tracking or auditing.
    *   High-risk changes (core logic, infrastructure, security).
    *   Requires clear handoffs between specialists.
*   Refer to specific mode documentation (e.g., `roo-commander` KB `04-delegation-mdtm.md`) for detailed criteria if available. If unsure, **err on the side of using MDTM** for better tracking.

**2. Procedure for Initiator (Coordinator/Lead/Manager):**

1.  **Generate Task ID:** Create a unique task ID following the convention `TASK-[MODE_PREFIX]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]` (e.g., `TASK-REACT-20250422-140500`).
2.  **Select Template:** Choose the appropriate MDTM template from `.ruru/templates/toml-md/` (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `02_mdtm_bug.md`).
3.  **Determine Path:** Construct the full path for the new task file within the `.ruru/tasks/` structure (e.g., `.ruru/tasks/FEATURE_Login/TASK-REACT-20250422-140500.md`).
4.  **Prepare Content:**
    *   **TOML Frontmatter:** Populate the `+++` block with essential metadata, adhering strictly to TOML syntax (Rule `01-standard-toml-md-format.md`). Include at minimum:
        *   `id`: The generated Task ID.
        *   `title`: Clear, concise task title.
        *   `status`: Set initially to `"🟡 To Do"` (or `"Pending"`).
        *   `type`: The appropriate task type (e.g., `"🌟 Feature"`, `"🐞 Bug"`).
        *   `assigned_to`: The slug of the target specialist mode (e.g., `"dev-react"`).
        *   `coordinator`: Your own mode's Task ID (e.g., `"TASK-CMD-..."`).
        *   `related_docs`: List paths to requirements, specs, etc.
        *   `tags`: Relevant keywords.
    *   **Markdown Body:** Fill in the Markdown sections (Description, Acceptance Criteria, Checklist). Define clear, actionable checklist items (`- [ ] Step description`).
5.  **Create Task File:** Use the `write_to_file` tool to create the MDTM task file at the determined path with the prepared TOML and Markdown content.
6.  **Log Creation:** Log the creation of the task file (including its path) according to standard logging procedures (Rule `12`).
7.  **Delegate via `new_task`:**
    *   Target the specialist mode specified in the `assigned_to` field.
    *   The `<message>` **MUST** clearly state: "Process MDTM task file: [Full path to the created .md file]". Include the Coordinator's Task ID for reference.
    *   Provide any *essential* immediate context if needed, but the primary instructions reside within the task file.
8.  **Update Initiator State:** Note that delegation has occurred. Await `attempt_completion` from the specialist. **Do not assume the task is being worked on in the background.**

**3. Responsibility of Assigned Specialist Mode:**

*   When receiving a `new_task` instruction referencing an MDTM task file:
    1.  **MUST** use `read_file` to load the content of the specified task file path.
    2.  **MUST** perform the work described in the Markdown body, following the checklist items.
    3.  **MUST** update the Markdown checklist (`- [ ]` -> `- [✅]`) as steps are completed using `apply_diff` or `search_and_replace`. Add brief notes/logs to the Markdown body as needed.
    4.  **MUST** update the `status` field in the **TOML block** of the task file upon completion (`"🟢 Done"`) or if blocked (`"⚪ Blocked"`), along with the `updated_date`, using `apply_diff`.
    5.  **MUST** report the final outcome back to the Coordinator using `attempt_completion`, referencing the MDTM task file path.

**Failure to create the MDTM file before delegation, or failure by the specialist to update the assigned file, breaks the tracking process.** This workflow is essential for managing complex tasks within the Roo system.

# Mandatory Rule: Generate OS-Aware and Syntactically Correct Commands

**Context:** Commands executed via `<execute_command>` run within the user's VS Code integrated terminal environment. The underlying operating system significantly impacts required command syntax. Assume the host OS is provided via context (e.g., `environment_details.os` with values like `win32`, `darwin`, `linux`).

**Rule:**

When formulating commands intended for execution via the `<execute_command>` tool, you **MUST** check the operating system context provided (e.g., `environment_details.os`) and generate commands appropriate for that specific platform's default shell, ensuring correct syntax, especially for command chaining.

**Platform-Specific Syntax & Chaining:**

*   **If OS is `win32` (Windows):**
    *   Target Shell: **PowerShell**.
    *   Examples: `Get-ChildItem` (or `ls`/`dir`), `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `New-Item -ItemType Directory`, `$env:VAR_NAME`, `python -m venv .venv`, `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate multiple commands that should run one after the other, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **INVALID OPERATOR:** **NEVER use `&&` for chaining commands.** It is invalid syntax in PowerShell and will cause errors like "The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator".
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** PowerShell lacks a simple *separator* like `&&`. To achieve this reliably with `<execute_command>`:
        1.  Execute the first command in one `<execute_command>` call.
        2.  **Await the result.** Check the `exit_code`. An exit code of `0` typically indicates success.
        3.  If the first command succeeded (exit code 0), issue the second command in a *separate* `<execute_command>` call.
        4.  **AVOID** generating complex PowerShell `if ($?) {...}` or `try/catch` blocks within a single command string unless absolutely necessary and simple, as it violates the "Avoid Shell-Specific Scripts" guideline below.
    *   Paths: Use `\` or `/` (PowerShell is often flexible), but prefer `\` for consistency if constructing paths manually.
    *   Quoting: Use single quotes `'...'` for literal strings. Use double quotes `"..."` if variable expansion is needed (less common for simple commands).

*   **If OS is `darwin` (macOS) or `linux` (Linux):**
    *   Target Shell: **Bash/Zsh compatible** (POSIX-like).
    *   Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `$VAR_NAME`, `python3 -m venv .venv`, `source .venv/bin/activate`.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Use semicolons **`;`** to separate commands that should run sequentially, regardless of success (e.g., `mkdir temp; cd temp`).
    *   **Conditional Execution (If Cmd1 Succeeds, Run Cmd2):** **MUST use the double ampersand `&&`** (e.g., `cd my_dir && ls -l`). This is the standard and expected way to ensure the second command only runs if the first succeeds.
    *   **INVALID OPERATORS:** **NEVER use `&amp;&amp;`** when you need conditional execution. **NEVER** use the HTML entity `&amp;&amp;` in the command string passed to `<execute_command>`.
    *   Paths: **MUST** use forward slashes `/`.
    *   Quoting: Use double quotes `"..."` generally, especially if needing variable expansion (`$VAR`). Use single quotes `'...'` for strict literal strings.

**General Guidelines (Applies to ALL OS):**

*   **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, common commands where possible.
*   **Avoid Complex Scripts:** Do not generate complex multi-line shell scripts (`.ps1`, `.sh`) unless specifically requested and appropriate for the task. Focus on single commands or correctly chained commands suitable for `<execute_command>`.
*   **Syntax Check:** **Double-check generated command syntax** before outputting it, paying close attention to the correct chaining operators (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), quoting, and path separators for the target OS.
*   **User Overrides:** If the user explicitly requests a command for a *different* shell (e.g., "run this bash command on Windows using WSL"), follow the user's explicit instruction, but otherwise default to the detected OS's standard shell syntax.

**Failure to generate OS-appropriate and syntactically correct commands, especially regarding chaining (`&&` vs `&amp;&amp;`), will likely result in execution errors for the user.** Always check the OS context and verify command syntax before generating commands.

# Standard Iterative Execution Policy

**Objective:** To ensure reliable task completion by preventing context window overflows and promoting manageable work increments, especially for generative or implementation tasks.

**Applies To:** All modes performing tasks that involve significant code generation, file modification, analysis, or following multi-step procedures (e.g., developers, writers, refactorers, testers, sometimes architects/managers). Less critical for simple lookups or coordination.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Prefer Smaller Steps:** Whenever feasible, break down complex requests into smaller, logical sub-tasks during the planning phase. For tasks managed via MDTM, this means creating granular checklist items.
2.  **Context Awareness:** Modes **MUST** be aware of their context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
3.  **Proactive Checkpointing:** Do not attempt to complete overly large tasks in a single execution turn, even if instructed broadly.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Task Planning:** When starting a task (especially one involving multiple steps or significant generation):
    *   Review the overall goal and acceptance criteria.
    *   If using MDTM, review the checklist items.
    *   Mentally estimate the complexity. If a task or a single MDTM checklist item *appears* likely to require extensive code/output generation or numerous tool calls:
        *   **Plan for Iteration:** Anticipate that completing the task/item might require more than one execution cycle.
        *   **(Optional but Recommended):** Inform the delegator (via `ask_followup_question` *before starting*) if you anticipate needing multiple steps/checkpoints for a single requested item.

2.  **Execution & Monitoring:** While executing the task (writing code, applying diffs, following checklist items):
    *   Periodically self-monitor context window usage (`{{CONTEXT_PERCENTAGE}}`).
    *   **Trigger Checkpoint:** If context usage approaches a threshold (e.g., **around 40-50%**), prepare to pause *after completing the current logical unit of work*.
        *   A "logical unit" could be:
            *   Completing the current MDTM checklist item (`- [✅]`).
            *   Finishing a complete function, class, or coherent block of code.
            *   Completing a specific file modification.
            *   Finishing a distinct step in an analysis process.

3.  **Checkpoint & Handover:** When pausing due to the context threshold OR completing a step marked for reporting (e.g., `📣` in MDTM):
    *   **Finalize Current Unit:** Ensure the immediate work unit is complete and syntactically correct (e.g., finish the function, close code blocks).
    *   **Summarize Progress:** Briefly state what was completed in the current turn.
    *   **Identify Next Step:** Clearly state the *next logical step* required to continue the overall task (e.g., "Next step is to implement the `handleUpdate` function", "Next step is to process MDTM item #3").
    *   **Report Status:** Use `<attempt_completion>` to report back to the delegator. Include:
        *   Confirmation of completed unit/step.
        *   Current context percentage.
        *   The identified *next step*.
        *   Any partial results or paths to modified/created files.
        *   *(Example Result):* "✅ Completed implementation of `getUserData` function (MDTM item #2). Context at 55%. Next step is to implement the `UserProfile` component using this data. Modified: `src/hooks/useUserData.ts`."

4.  **Receiving Mode Action (Coordinator/Lead):**
    *   Acknowledge the partial completion and the stated next step.
    *   Log the progress (Rule `12`).
    *   Re-delegate the *next step* back to the specialist mode, providing the necessary context (including the original goal and referencing the previous work/files).

**Rationale:**

*   **Context Safety:** Prevents hitting hard context limits which often lead to truncated, incomplete, or erroneous responses.
*   **Error Reduction:** Smaller execution units reduce the chance of complex errors accumulating within a single turn.
*   **State Management:** Encourages breaking work into steps that align well with MDTM tracking, improving visibility.
*   **User Experience:** While it involves more turns, it leads to more reliable progress compared to large failures requiring complete restarts.

**Note:** The 50-60% threshold is a guideline. Modes should use judgment. If a small, final step pushes usage slightly over, completing it might be acceptable. The key is to avoid *starting* a large unit of work when context is already high.

# Guideline: Vertex AI MCP Tool Usage

**Objective:** To standardize how modes interact with the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`, particularly regarding output handling and the use of research/validation capabilities.

**Applies To:** All modes utilizing tools provided by the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`.

**1. Tool Availability:**

*   Modes receive the list of available MCP tools dynamically in their context. Use these tools only if the `vertex-ai-mcp-server` is connected and the specific tool is listed.
*   Modes should gracefully handle scenarios where the MCP server or specific tools are unavailable.

**2. Output Handling Strategy (General):**

*   **Default to `save_*`:** When using Vertex AI MCP tools that have a corresponding `save_*` variant (e.g., `save_generate_project_guidelines`, `save_doc_snippet`, `save_topic_explanation`, `save_answer_query_direct`, `save_answer_query_websearch`), **prefer using the `save_*` variant** for potentially long or complex outputs.
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents large outputs from cluttering the chat history, archives the result for later reference, and helps manage context window size.
*   **Use Direct Tools Sparingly:** Use the direct output tools (e.g., `answer_query_websearch`, `explain_topic_with_docs`, `get_doc_snippets`) only when the expected output is known to be concise (e.g., a single code snippet, a short definition, a simple yes/no answer) or when specifically requested by the user/coordinator for an inline response.
*   **Reporting Saved Files:** When using a `save_*` tool, the mode **MUST** report the full path to the saved file back to the coordinator/user via `<attempt_completion>`. (See Section 2.1 for handling persistent context outputs.)

**2.1. Handling Persistent Context Outputs:**

*   **Identify Need:** If the output generated by a `save_*` tool is intended to be *persistent context* referenced directly by mode rules, KBs, or long-term documentation (unlike temporary analysis results):
    1.  **Move & Rename:** After the `save_*` tool successfully creates the file in the default `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` location, the coordinating mode **MUST** immediately use a file system tool (`execute_command` with `mkdir -p` and `mv`, or the `vertex-ai-mcp-server`'s `create_directory` and `move_file_or_directory` tools) to:
        *   Ensure a `context/` subdirectory exists within the relevant mode's directory (e.g., `.ruru/modes/[mode-slug]/context/`).
        *   Move the generated file from `.ruru/docs/vertex/...` into this mode-specific `context/` directory.
        *   Rename the file to something meaningful and versioned if appropriate (e.g., `[mode-slug]_context_[topic]_v1.md`) instead of the default timestamped name.
    2.  **Update References:** Any rules, KBs, or documents referencing this context **MUST** be updated immediately to point to the new, persistent path within the mode's `context/` directory.
    3.  **Log Move:** Log the move and rename operation.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures that context critical to a mode's operation is stored logically with the mode and avoids broken references if the general `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory is treated as temporary. The default timestamped location should be used for transient outputs or initial review before deciding on persistence.

**3. Standard Output Location & Naming:**

*   **Base Directory:** All files generated by `save_*` tools **MUST** be saved within the `.ruru/docs/vertex/` directory.
*   **Subdirectory Structure:** Organize files by the *type* of tool used:
    *   `save_generate_project_guidelines` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/`
    *   `save_doc_snippet` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/snippets/`
    *   `save_topic_explanation` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/explanations/`
    *   `save_answer_query_direct` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-direct/`
    *   `save_answer_query_websearch` -> `.ruru/docs/vertex/answers-web/`
*   **File Naming Convention:** Files **MUST** be named using the format `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]-[sanitized_topic_or_query].md`.
    *   `[YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]`: Timestamp generated by the mode at the time of the call.
    *   `[sanitized_topic_or_query]`: A filesystem-safe representation of the primary topic or query (e.g., replace spaces/special characters with `_`, limit length to ~50 characters).
    *   *Example:* `.ruru/docs/vertex/guidelines/20250426182500-react_ts_node_guidelines.md`

**4. Using MCP for Research & Validation ("Brains Trust"):**

*   **Targeted Use:** While tools like `answer_query_websearch` can provide external context or validation, their use should be targeted and judicious due to latency, cost, and potential complexity.
*   **Prioritize Internal Context:** Modes **MUST** prioritize using internal project knowledge (KBs, rules, existing code, task context) before resorting to external MCP calls for validation or general research.
*   **Recommended Modes:** Consider enabling or encouraging this capability primarily within modes focused on architecture, research, complex problem-solving, or senior-level review (e.g., `technical-architect`, `agent-research`, `complex-problem-solver`, `util-senior-dev`, `util-second-opinion`).
*   **Clear Triggers:** Modes utilizing external validation should have clear triggers defined in their specific rules/KBs (e.g., "when evaluating unfamiliar technology", "if confidence is low").
*   **Log Usage:** Log instances where external validation was sought via MCP, including the query and a summary of the outcome, according to standard logging procedures (Rule `08-logging-procedure-simplified.md`).

**Adherence to these guidelines ensures consistent, traceable, and efficient use of the Vertex AI MCP capabilities.**</custom_instructions>
