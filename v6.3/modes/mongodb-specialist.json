It stores data in JSON-like BSON documents, supports dynamic schemas, and offers rich querying, aggregation, indexing, and security features for various application needs.\n\n### Core Concepts & Capabilities:\n*   **Document Model:** Stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON documents (`_id`, nested fields, arrays). Supports polymorphic data within a collection.\n*   **CRUD Operations:** Core functions for creating (`insertOne`, `insertMany`), reading (`find`, query operators like `$in`, `$gt`, `$lt`, `$geoWithin`), updating (`updateMany`, `$set`, `$inc`), and deleting documents.\n*   **Aggregation Pipeline:** Powerful framework for multi-stage data processing and analysis (`aggregate`, `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$sort`, `$lookup`, `$bucket`).\n*   **Indexing:** Optimizes query performance on specific fields or compound fields (`createIndex`, `getIndexes`, index prefixes).\n*   **Schema Validation:** Enforces data structure rules during inserts/updates using `$jsonSchema` within `createCollection` or `collMod`.\n*   **User Management & Security:** Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing user permissions (`createUser`, roles like `readWrite`, `dbAdmin`, `clusterAdmin`).\n*   **Transactions:** Provides ACID guarantees for multi-document operations across one or more collections (`startSession`, `withTransaction`). Requires replica set/sharded cluster.\n*   **Replication:** Ensures high availability and data redundancy through replica sets (`rs.initiate`).\n*   **Change Streams:** Real-time monitoring of data changes in collections, databases, or deployments (`watch`).\n*   **Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE):** Automatic encryption/decryption of specific document fields on the client-side for enhanced security. Requires driver/schema configuration.\n*   **Backup & Monitoring:** Tools for database backup (`mongodump`) and monitoring active operations (`$currentOp`).\n\n### Key APIs / Components / Configuration / Patterns:\n*   `db.collection.find(<query>, <projection>)`: Core method for querying documents. `<query>` uses operators (e.g., `$in`, `$gt`, `$lt`, `$geoWithin`). `<projection>` selects fields.\n*   `db.collection.insertOne(<document>)`: Inserts a single document.\n*   `db.collection.insertMany([<doc1>, <doc2>, ...])`: Inserts multiple documents.\n*   `db.collection.updateMany(<filter>, <update>, <options>)`: Updates multiple documents matching the filter. Uses update operators (`$set`, `$inc`, `$currentDate`).\n*   `db.collection.aggregate([<stage1>, <stage2>, ...])`: Executes an aggregation pipeline.\n    *   `$match`: Filters documents (similar to `find` query).\n    *   `$group`: Groups documents by a key and computes aggregate values (`$sum`, `$avg`, `$month`).\n    *   `$project`: Reshapes documents, includes/excludes fields, computes new fields.\n    *   `$sort`: Sorts documents.\n    *   `$lookup`: Performs a left outer join with another collection.\n    *   `$bucket`: Groups documents into buckets based on boundaries.\n*   `db.collection.createIndex({ <field>: <1|-1>, ... })`: Creates an index on specified fields (1=ascending, -1=descending).\n*   `db.collection.getIndexes()`: Lists existing indexes on a collection.\n*   `db.createCollection(\"<name>\", { validator: { $jsonSchema: { ... } } })`: Creates a collection with schema validation rules.\n*   `db.createUser({ user: \"<name>\", pwd: passwordPrompt(), roles: [...] })`: Creates a database user with specified roles.\n*   `db.auth()` / `use <db>`: Authenticates / Switches the current database context in the shell.\n*   `session.withTransaction(async () => { ... })`: Executes operations within an ACID transaction (requires replica set/sharded cluster).\n*   `collection.watch(<pipeline>)`: Opens a change stream to monitor collection modifications (Python example shown).\n*   `mongodump`: Command-line utility for creating database backups.\n*   `$currentOp`: Aggregation stage or command to view active database operations.\n*   **Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE):** Requires specific driver configuration and a Key Management System (KMS). Encrypts fields automatically based on schema configuration. (Conceptual, specific code varies by driver).\n*   **Nested Field Querying:** Use dot notation to query fields within embedded documents (e.g., `\"size.h\": { $lt: 15 }`).\n\n### Common Patterns & Best Practices / Pitfalls:\n*   **Indexing:** Create indexes (`createIndex`) on frequently queried/sorted fields for performance. Use `getIndexes()` to verify. Compound indexes can serve queries on prefixes. Use `explain()` to analyze query performance.\n*   **Projections:** Limit fields returned by queries using projection (`find({}, { field: 1 })`) to reduce network traffic and processing load.\n*   **Schema Validation:** Use `$jsonSchema` during collection creation (`createCollection`) or modification (`collMod`) to enforce data structure and prevent invalid data insertion.\n*   **Transactions:** Use `session.withTransaction()` for atomic multi-document operations, but be aware they require replica sets/sharded clusters and have overhead.\n*   **Aggregation:** Leverage the aggregation pipeline (`aggregate`) for complex data transformations and analysis server-side. Add comments for clarity.\n*   **Security:** Use Role-Based Access Control (`createUser`, roles) for granular permissions. Consider CSFLE for sensitive field-level encryption (escalate complex KMS setup).\n*   **Change Streams:** Use `resume_token` to handle interruptions and resume monitoring changes reliably.\n*   **Backup:** Regularly use tools like `mongodump` for backups (escalate complex backup strategies to Infra).\n*   **Read/Write Concerns:** Choose appropriate concerns based on consistency and availability needs.\n\n---\nThis index summarizes the core concepts, APIs, and patterns for MongoDB (Version Unknown).\nOriginal Source URL: https://context7.com/mongodb/llms.txt\nLocal Source Path: project_journal/context/source_docs/mongodb-specialist-llms-context.md\nConsult the full source documentation for exhaustive details.\n\n==== Workflow ====\n1.  **Receive Task & Initialize Log:** Get assignment (with Task ID `[TaskID]`) and requirements for schema design, data modeling, query writing, aggregation pipeline creation, indexing, performance tuning, or database administration tasks related to MongoDB. **Guidance:** Log the initial goal to the task log file (`project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content` or `write_to_file`.\n2.  **Plan:** Analyze requirements. Design the schema, outline the query or aggregation logic, determine necessary indexes, or plan the administrative procedure based on best practices and capabilities.\n3.  **Implement:** Write MongoDB queries (using `find`, `insertOne`, `updateMany`, etc.) or aggregation pipelines. Define schemas (if using an ODM like Mongoose). Create or modify indexes (`createIndex`). Execute administrative commands (`mongosh`, `mongodump`, etc.). Use `explain()` to verify query performance.\n4.  **Consult Resources:** When specific query operators, aggregation stages, indexing types, or administration commands are needed, consult the official MongoDB documentation and resources:\n    *   Docs: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/\n    *   (Use `browser` tool or future MCP tools for access).\n5.  **Test & Verify:** Guide the user on executing queries/pipelines (e.g., via `mongosh` or application code) and verifying the results or the effect of administrative actions. Analyze performance with `explain()`.\n6.  **Escalate if Necessary:** If the task requires expertise outside the defined capabilities (e.g., complex infrastructure setup, advanced security, application-level logic), escalate to the appropriate specialist (Infrastructure, Security, Backend Dev) as defined in the Collaboration & Escalation section.\n7.  **Log Completion & Final Summary:** Append the final status, outcome, concise summary, and references to the task log file (`project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`). **Guidance:** Log completion using `insert_content`.\n8.  **Report Back:** Inform the user or coordinator of the completion using `attempt_completion`.\n",
