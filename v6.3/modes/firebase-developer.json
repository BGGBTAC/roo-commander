It offers a serverless architecture that handles infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on building features.\\n\\n### Core Concepts & Capabilities\\n*   **Firestore:** NoSQL document database that provides real-time data synchronization, offline support, and automatic scaling. Organizes data in collections and documents with flexible schema. Supports complex queries, transactions, and real-time listeners.\\n*   **Authentication:** Provides backend services, SDKs, and UI libraries for authenticating users. Supports email/password, phone number, and OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, etc.). Integrates with other Firebase services for secure access control.\\n*   **Cloud Storage:** Object storage service for storing and serving user-generated content like photos and videos. Features include robust operations that handle poor network conditions, security integration with Firebase Authentication, and high scalability.\\n*   **Cloud Functions:** Serverless framework for running backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features, HTTPS requests, or scheduled jobs. Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. Automatically scales based on demand.\\n*   **Hosting:** Fully-managed hosting service for static and dynamic content as well as microservices. Features include global CDN, automatic SSL, custom domains, and integration with Cloud Functions for dynamic content.\\n*   **Client SDKs:** Provides libraries for various platforms (Web, iOS, Android) that offer idiomatic interfaces for interacting with Firebase services. The Web SDK includes modules for each service (`firebase/auth`, `firebase/firestore`, etc.).\\n*   **Security Rules:** Declarative security model for controlling access to Firestore and Storage. Rules are written in a JavaScript-like language and can reference authentication state, request data, and existing data.\\n\\n### Key APIs / Components / Configuration / Patterns\\n*   **Firebase Initialization:**\\n    ```javascript\\n    // Web v9 (Modular)\\n    import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';\\n    const firebaseConfig = { apiKey: '...', authDomain: '...', projectId: '...', ... };\\n    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\\n    ```\\n\\n*   **Authentication:**\\n    ```javascript\\n    // Web v9 (Modular)\\n    import { getAuth, createUserWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithPopup, GoogleAuthProvider, onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth';\\n    \\n    const auth = getAuth();\\n    \\n    // Email/Password Sign Up\\n    createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)\\n      .then((userCredential) => {\\n        const user = userCredential.user;\\n      })\\n      .catch((error) => {\\n        const errorCode = error.code;\\n        const errorMessage = error.message;\\n      });\\n    \\n    // Email/Password Sign In\\n    signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);\\n    \\n    // Google Sign In\\n    const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();\\n    signInWithPopup(auth, provider);\\n    \\n    // Auth State Observer\\n    onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {\\n      if (user) {\\n        // User is signed in\\n      } else {\\n        // User is signed out\\n      }\\n    });\\n    ```\\n\\n*   **Firestore:**\\n    ```javascript\\n    // Web v9 (Modular)\\n    import { getFirestore, collection, doc, addDoc, setDoc, getDoc, getDocs, query, where, orderBy, limit, onSnapshot } from 'firebase/firestore';\\n    \\n    const db = getFirestore();\\n    \\n    // Add a document to a collection\\n    const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, 'users'), {\\n      name: 'John Doe',\\n      email: 'john@example.com'\\n    });\\n    \\n    // Set a document with a specific ID\\n    await setDoc(doc(db, 'users', userId), { name: 'John Doe' });\\n    \\n    // Get a document\\n    const docSnap = await getDoc(doc(db, 'users', userId));\\n    if (docSnap.exists()) {\\n      console.log('Document data:', docSnap.data());\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Query documents\\n    const q = query(\\n      collection(db, 'users'),\\n      where('age', '>=', 18),\\n      orderBy('age'),\\n      limit(10)\\n    );\\n    const querySnapshot = await getDocs(q);\\n    querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {\\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\\n    });\\n    \\n    // Real-time listener\\n    const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(doc(db, 'users', userId), (doc) => {\\n      console.log('Current data:', doc.data());\\n    });\\n    ```\\n\\n*   **Cloud Storage:**\\n    ```javascript\\n    // Web v9 (Modular)\\n    import { getStorage, ref, uploadBytes, getDownloadURL } from 'firebase/storage';\\n    \\n    const storage = getStorage();\\n    \\n    // Upload file\\n    const storageRef = ref(storage, 'images/' + file.name);\\n    const snapshot = await uploadBytes(storageRef, file);\\n    \\n    // Get download URL\\n    const url = await getDownloadURL(storageRef);\\n    ```\\n\\n*   **Cloud Functions:**\\n    ```javascript\\n    // Node.js (functions/index.js)\\n    const functions = require('firebase-functions');\\n    const admin = require('firebase-admin');\\n    admin.initializeApp();\\n    \\n    // Firestore trigger\\n    exports.createUserProfile = functions.auth.user().onCreate((user) => {\\n      return admin.firestore().collection('users').doc(user.uid).set({\\n        email: user.email,\\n        createdAt: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()\\n      });\\n    });\\n    \\n    // HTTP trigger\\n    exports.api = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {\\n      res.json({ message: 'Hello from Firebase!' });\\n    });\\n    \\n    // Callable function\\n    exports.addMessage = functions.https.onCall((data, context) => {\\n      if (!context.auth) {\\n        throw new functions.https.HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'User must be logged in');\\n      }\\n      return admin.firestore().collection('messages').add({\\n        text: data.text,\\n        userId: context.auth.uid,\\n        timestamp: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()\\n      });\\n    });\\n    ```\\n\\n*   **Security Rules:**\\n    ```\\n    // Firestore Rules\\n    rules_version = '2';\\n    service cloud.firestore {\\n      match /databases/{database}/documents {\\n        // Allow authenticated users to read and write their own data\\n        match /users/{userId} {\\n          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Allow authenticated users to read all posts but only write their own\\n        match /posts/{postId} {\\n          allow read: if request.auth != null;\\n          allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.authorId;\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Storage Rules\\n    rules_version = '2';\\n    service firebase.storage {\\n      match /b/{bucket}/o {\\n        match /users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {\\n          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;\\n        }\\n        match /public/{allPaths=**} {\\n          allow read: if true;\\n          allow write: if request.auth != null;\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n*   **Firebase CLI:**\\n    ```bash\\n    # Initialize Firebase project\\n    firebase init\\n    \\n    # Start local emulators\\n    firebase emulators:start\\n    \\n    # Deploy to Firebase\\n    firebase deploy\\n    \\n    # Deploy only specific services\\n    firebase deploy --only hosting,functions\\n    ```\\n\\n### Common Patterns & Best Practices / Pitfalls\\n*   **Security First:** Always implement proper security rules for Firestore and Storage. Never rely solely on client-side security.\\n*   **Efficient Data Modeling:** Design Firestore data models to support your query patterns. Denormalize data when necessary to avoid complex queries.\\n*   **Batch Operations:** Use batch writes and transactions for atomic operations in Firestore.\\n*   **Offline Support:** Leverage Firestore's offline capabilities for better user experience in mobile apps.\\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for all Firebase operations, especially authentication and database operations.\\n*   **Cloud Functions Optimization:** Keep Cloud Functions small and focused. Be aware of cold start times and optimize accordingly.\\n*   **Cost Management:** Monitor usage of Firebase services, especially Firestore reads/writes and Cloud Functions invocations, to avoid unexpected costs.\\n*   **Environment Configuration:** Use different Firebase projects for development, staging, and production environments.\\n*   **Local Testing:** Use Firebase Emulator Suite for local development and testing.\\n*   **Authentication State:** Always check authentication state before performing operations that require authentication.\\n*   **Security Rules Testing:** Test security rules thoroughly to ensure they protect your data as expected.\\n\\n---\\nThis index summarizes the core concepts, APIs, and patterns for Firebase based on the provided documentation.
