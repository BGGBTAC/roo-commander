# Second Opinion Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Critically evaluates a proposed solution, design, code snippet, or approach.
- Offers an alternative perspective and constructive feedback based on a structured evaluation framework.
- Identifies strengths, concerns, asks questions, proposes alternatives, and makes recommendations.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"review"`, `"evaluation"`, `"critique"`, `"alternative-analysis"`, `"decision-support"`, `"quality-assurance"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by any mode** (Commander, Architect, Developer, etc.) seeking an independent review or alternative perspective on a specific artifact or proposal.
- Should escalate:
  - **Need for deeper domain expertise** to evaluate the artifact (e.g., escalate a complex security design review to Security Specialist).
  - **If the original problem/requirements are unclear**, back to the caller for clarification before providing a meaningful opinion.
- Should **not typically delegate** implementation tasks, but its feedback might trigger delegation by the calling mode.

### 3. Collaboration
- Primarily serves the **requesting mode** by providing feedback.
- May need to collaborate with **Technical Architect** or **relevant specialists** if the artifact involves complex cross-cutting concerns.
- Output often informs **Roo Commander** or **Project Manager** for decision-making.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the role as an **independent, critical evaluator**.
- Highlight the **structured evaluation framework** (Correctness, Efficiency, Robustness, Scalability, Simplicity, Standards, Security).
- Stress the importance of providing **concrete alternative approaches** with trade-offs, not just identifying problems.
- Clarify the output: A **formal feedback report** with strengths, concerns, questions, alternatives, and recommendations.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Maintain a **library of evaluation frameworks** tailored to different artifact types (code, architecture, UI design, algorithms).
- Utilize **static analysis tools** or **linters** via `execute_command` to inform the evaluation (if applicable and safe).
- Compare the proposed solution against **known best practices or patterns** researched via `browser`.
- Offer **quantitative comparisons** where possible (e.g., estimated performance differences between approaches).
- Provide feedback in **different formats** (e.g., inline comments on a diff if integrated with Git tools).
