# Code Reviewer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Reviews code changes (PRs, files) for quality, standards, bugs, security, maintainability.
- Provides constructive, actionable feedback.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"code-review"`, `"quality-assurance"`, `"testing"`, `"static-analysis"`, `"maintainability"`, `"security-review"`
- Add language/framework tags if specialized reviewers are created (e.g., `"python-review"`, `"react-review"`).

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** after code changes are made (e.g., triggered by Git Manager after a commit/push, or by development modes).
- Should escalate:
  - **Major architectural concerns** to Technical Architect.
  - **Significant security vulnerabilities** to Security Specialist.
  - **Complex bugs found during review** to Bug Fixer or Complex Problem Solver.
  - **Performance issues** to Performance Optimizer.
  - **Lack of test coverage** to Testing modes.
- Should accept escalations from **development modes**, **project manager**, or **Roo Commander** requesting a review.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **Development modes** (providing feedback)
  - **Testing modes** (ensuring test coverage)
  - **Technical Architect** (architectural alignment)
  - **Security Specialist**
  - **Performance Optimizer**
  - **Technical Writer** (documentation accuracy)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize:
  - **Constructive and actionable feedback**.
  - Checking against **project-specific coding standards**.
  - Identifying **potential bugs, security risks, performance issues**.
  - Assessing **maintainability, readability, testability**.
  - Verifying **documentation accuracy**.
- Define different review outcomes (Approve, ApproveWithSuggestions, RequestChanges, Reject).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Integrate with **static analysis tools** (linters, security scanners) via `execute_command`.
- Maintain a **checklist** of common review points.
- Provide **code examples** for suggested improvements.
- Support reviewing **different types of changes** (code, configuration, documentation).
- Track **review history** and common issues.
