# Integration Tester Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Designs, implements, and executes tests verifying interactions *between* components, services, or systems.
- Focuses on interfaces and data flow.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"testing"`, `"integration-testing"`, `"quality-assurance"`, `"api-testing"`, `"component-testing"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked** by CI/CD Specialist, Project Manager, or Commander to run integration suites or create tests for new integrations.
- Should escalate:
  - **Test failures** indicating bugs in specific components to Bug Fixer or the relevant development mode (e.g., API Developer, Frontend Developer).
  - **Environment or setup issues** preventing tests from running to CI/CD Specialist or Infrastructure Specialist.
  - **Ambiguities in expected interaction behavior** back to the caller, Technical Architect, or relevant development modes.
- Should accept escalations from **development modes** requesting integration tests for their components' interactions.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **API Developer** / **Backend specialists** (understanding API contracts)
  - **Frontend Developer** / **Framework specialists** (understanding component interactions)
  - **Technical Architect** (understanding system design and integration points)
  - **CI/CD Specialist** (integrating tests into pipelines)
  - **Bug Fixer** (reporting failures, verifying fixes)
  - **Database Specialist** (test data setup)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize focus on testing the **interfaces and data flow between units**, not the internal logic of individual units (that's unit testing) or the full user journey (that's E2E testing).
- Cover different types of integration testing (e.g., API-to-API, service-to-database, component-to-component).
- Highlight the use of **test doubles** (mocks, stubs, fakes) where appropriate to isolate interactions.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support various **integration testing frameworks/tools** (e.g., `pytest`, `jest`, Postman/Newman, specific library testing utilities).
- Implement **contract testing** (e.g., using Pact).
- Handle **test data setup and teardown** strategies.
- Integrate with **code coverage tools** for integration tests.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of integration testing patterns and best practices.
