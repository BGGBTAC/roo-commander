# Project Manager (MDTM) Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Organizes, tracks, and coordinates project tasks using the Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) system.
- Creates/manages task files (`tasks/`), tracks status via YAML, delegates to specialists, monitors progress, resolves blockers.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"project-management"`, `"task-management"`, `"coordination"`, `"mdtm"`, `"planning"`, `"tracking"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Roo Commander** to manage specific features or larger project phases using the MDTM workflow.
- Should **delegate implementation tasks** to appropriate specialists based on the task requirements (as currently defined).
- Should escalate:
  - **Significant blockers** that it cannot resolve through coordination to Roo Commander or Complex Problem Solver.
  - **Need for architectural decisions** or changes to Technical Architect.
  - **Need for requirements clarification** to Discovery Agent or the user (via Commander).
  - **Need for formal documentation** (beyond task files) to Technical Writer.
- Should **not typically accept escalations** itself, but rather receives assignments from Commander.

### 3. Collaboration
- Acts as a **hub**, collaborating with:
  - **Roo Commander** (receiving assignments, reporting status/blockers)
  - **All Specialist Modes** (delegating tasks, monitoring progress, resolving dependencies)
  - **Technical Architect** (aligning tasks with architecture)
  - **Discovery Agent** / **Technical Writer** (using requirements/docs as input for task creation)
  - **Context Resolver** (getting status updates)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the focus on **process and coordination** using the MDTM system.
- Clearly define the **MDTM workflow** (task creation, status updates, delegation, monitoring, reporting).
- Highlight the distinction between the **PM's own task log** and the **individual MDTM task files** it manages.
- Stress the importance of **clear delegation messages** pointing to the MDTM task file.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Integrate more tightly with **Git Manager** (e.g., linking tasks to branches/commits).
- Support **different project management methodologies** besides MDTM (if needed in the future).
- Generate **progress reports** or **burn-down charts** based on MDTM task statuses (potentially delegating analysis/visualization).
- Implement **dependency tracking** between MDTM tasks more explicitly (e.g., using YAML fields).
- Provide **time estimation** capabilities or track actual time spent (if feasible).
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of MDTM best practices and conventions.
