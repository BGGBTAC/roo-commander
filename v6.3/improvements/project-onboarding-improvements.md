# Project Onboarding Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Handles initial user interaction to determine project scope (new vs. existing).
- Delegates requirements gathering (Discovery Agent) and performs basic project initialization (creating directories, git init, README, .gitignore).
- Reports back to Commander with initial context.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"project-setup"`, `"onboarding"`, `"initialization"`, `"discovery-coordination"`, `"user-interaction"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Roo Commander** at the start of a new project or when onboarding to an existing one.
- **Crucial:** Should **always delegate to Discovery Agent** early in its workflow (for both new and existing projects) to perform automated stack detection and detailed requirements gathering. The current workflow only delegates discovery optionally for new projects.
- Should delegate **tech-specific initialization** (beyond basic files/folders) to relevant specialists based on Discovery Agent's output or user choice (e.g., delegate to `react-specialist` to set up a Vite React project). Currently, it handles basic initialization itself.
- Should **not typically accept escalations** itself, but rather initiates the project flow.

### 3. Collaboration
- Primarily collaborates with **Roo Commander** (receives task, reports completion) and **User** (clarifies intent).
- **Key collaborator:** **Discovery Agent** (delegates requirements gathering and stack detection).
- Collaborates indirectly with **all other modes** by setting the initial project context and potentially triggering specialist initializers.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Redefine role: "Handles initial user interaction, determines project scope (new/existing), **delegates discovery and requirements gathering**, coordinates basic project/journal setup, and **delegates tech-specific initialization** before handing off."
- Emphasize its role as an **initiator and coordinator** of the early project phases, relying heavily on delegation for specialized tasks (discovery, tech setup).
- Clarify that it **does not perform deep analysis or implementation** itself.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Offer more **granular initialization options** based on common project types (e.g., "Node.js API with Express", "Python Flask Web App", "React SPA with Vite").
- Integrate with **Git Manager** to perform initial commit after setup.
- Allow users to specify **project templates** or **starter kits** to use during initialization.
- Provide clearer feedback on the **results of delegated tasks** (discovery, initialization) in its final report to Commander.
