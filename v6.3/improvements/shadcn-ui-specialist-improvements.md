# Shadcn UI Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Specializes in building UIs using Shadcn UI components with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Covers component composition, customization via CLI and Tailwind, theming, and integration with `react-hook-form`/`zod`.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"shadcn-ui"`, `"react"`, `"tailwind"`, `"ui-library"`, `"component-library"`, `"frontend"`, `"design-system"`, `"radix-ui"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when discovery detects Shadcn UI usage (CLI usage, `components.json`, specific component imports/folder structure).
- Should escalate:
  - **Complex React logic** not directly related to component composition to React Specialist.
  - **Advanced Tailwind CSS customization** beyond standard utility application to Tailwind Specialist.
  - **Accessibility issues** not covered by Radix UI primitives to Accessibility Specialist.
  - **Form validation logic** beyond basic Zod schema integration potentially to React Specialist or a dedicated forms specialist.
  - **Data table logic** beyond basic setup (`@tanstack/react-table`) potentially to React Specialist or a data table specialist.
- Should accept escalations from **project onboarding**, **UI Designer**, **React Specialist**, **Tailwind Specialist**, or **Frontend Developer**.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **React Specialist** (integrating components, state management)
  - **Tailwind Specialist** (custom styling, theme alignment)
  - **UI Designer** (implementing designs using Shadcn components)
  - **Accessibility Specialist** (ensuring accessible composition)
  - **Frontend Developer** (general integration)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the **compositional nature** of Shadcn UI (using CLI to add code, not installing a library).
- Highlight the reliance on **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Radix UI** for accessibility/primitives.
- Cover the **CLI workflow** (`init`, `add`).
- Detail **theming** via CSS variables and `ThemeProvider`.
- Explain integration patterns with **`react-hook-form` and `zod`**.
- Cover usage of key components like **Forms, Data Tables, Dialogs, Command Menus**.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Provide guidance on **customizing component source code** after adding via CLI.
- Handle **updates** to Shadcn UI components (requires careful diffing or re-adding).
- Support integration with **different frameworks** if Shadcn UI expands beyond React/Next.js.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of Shadcn UI patterns, customization techniques, and common issues.
- Advise on **building custom components** following Shadcn UI principles.
