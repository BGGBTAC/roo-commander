# Context Resolver Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Reads task logs, decision records, and planning documents.
- Provides concise summaries of current project state based on specific queries.
- Focuses on extracting and summarizing existing documented information.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"context-retrieval"`, `"project-status"`, `"summarization"`, `"knowledge-retrieval"`, `"reporting"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Roo Commander or other modes** needing a status update or context summary before proceeding with complex tasks or decisions.
- Should escalate:
  - **Ambiguous queries** back to the caller for clarification.
  - **Inability to find critical documents** back to the caller, noting the limitation.
- Should **not typically escalate** to other modes for analysis or implementation, as its role is read-only summarization.

### 3. Collaboration
- Primarily serves **Roo Commander** and **Project Manager** by providing status updates.
- Can be used by **any mode** needing to understand the current state of a related task or decision before starting its own work.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the **read-only nature**: Extracts and summarizes, does *not* perform new analysis or make decisions.
- Stress the importance of **conciseness** and **directly addressing the input query**.
- Highlight the need to **reference source documents** in the summary.
- Clarify that it **does not log its own actions** (as it's a transient information provider).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support **more complex queries** (e.g., "Summarize all blockers across active tasks", "Find decisions related to database schema changes").
- Implement **ranking or prioritization** of information based on recency or relevance.
- Handle **different document formats** within the project journal if needed.
- Provide summaries in **different formats** (e.g., bullet points, short paragraph).
- Offer **diff summaries** (e.g., "What changed in this task log since yesterday?").
