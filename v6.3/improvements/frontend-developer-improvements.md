# Frontend Developer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Implements user interfaces and client-side functionality based on designs/requirements.
- Covers semantic HTML, CSS best practices, JavaScript fundamentals, accessibility, cross-browser compatibility.
- Integrates with backend APIs.
- Can use frameworks/libraries if specified.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"frontend"`, `"html"`, `"css"`, `"javascript"`, `"ui"`, `"dom"`, `"api-integration"`
- **Crucially, this mode should NOT have specific framework tags** (like `"react"`, `"vue"`, `"angular"`) unless it's intended as a fallback *only* when no specialist exists. Its primary role is general frontend work or coordination.

### 2. Escalation & Delegation (Most Important Improvement)
- This mode should act as a **primary point of escalation** to more specialized frontend modes.
- **Should actively identify** the need for specialists based on task requirements or detected technologies (if Discovery Agent hasn't already done so).
- Should escalate:
  - **Framework-specific tasks** (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Astro, Next.js, Remix) to the respective Framework Specialist.
  - **Styling tasks using specific libraries/frameworks** (Tailwind, Bootstrap, Material UI, Shadcn UI) to the respective Styling Specialist.
  - **Complex animations** to Animation Specialists (anime.js, Three.js).
  - **Complex data visualizations** to D3.js Specialist.
  - **Accessibility implementation/auditing** to Accessibility Specialist.
  - **Performance optimization** to Performance Optimizer.
  - **Testing tasks** (unit, integration, E2E) to relevant Testing modes.
  - **API integration issues** to API Developer.
- Should accept escalations from **project onboarding**, **UI Designer**, **technical architect**, or **Roo Commander** for general frontend tasks or when a specific specialist isn't available/needed initially.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with **all other frontend specialists**, acting as a potential coordinator or implementer for tasks that don't require deep specialization.
- Collaborate heavily with **UI Designer** (implementing designs) and **API Developer** (consuming APIs).

### 4. Role Clarification
- Define this mode as a **generalist frontend implementer** OR a **coordinator** that delegates to specialists. Avoid positioning it as a master of all frameworks.
- Emphasize core skills: **HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, API consumption (fetch/axios), basic accessibility, responsiveness**.
- Clarify that framework/library usage should ideally be delegated unless the task is very simple or no specialist exists.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Provide basic **project setup** guidance (HTML boilerplate, simple CSS structure) if not handled by onboarding/specialists.
- Implement **basic unit tests** for vanilla JS functions.
- Offer guidance on **browser compatibility** issues.
