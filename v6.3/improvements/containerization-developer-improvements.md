# Containerization Developer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Specializes in Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), Docker Swarm, Nomad.
- Designs, builds, secures, and manages containerized applications.
- Handles Dockerfiles, image management, orchestration manifests, networking, security, and CI/CD integration.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"docker"`, `"kubernetes"`, `"k8s"`, `"containerization"`, `"orchestration"`, `"devops"`, `"docker-compose"`, `"nomad"`, `"infrastructure"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when discovery detects Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`, K8s manifests, or containerization requirements.
- Should escalate:
  - **Underlying infrastructure issues** (VMs, networking, cloud resources) to Infrastructure Specialist.
  - **CI/CD pipeline integration details** to CI/CD Specialist.
  - **Application build issues** within the container to relevant language/framework specialists.
  - **Security vulnerabilities** found during image scanning to Security Specialist or relevant development modes.
- Should accept escalations from **project onboarding**, **technical architect**, **CI/CD specialist**, or development modes needing containerization.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **Infrastructure Specialist** (deployment targets, networking)
  - **CI/CD Specialist** (pipeline integration)
  - **Development modes** (application build process, dependencies)
  - **Security Specialist** (image scanning, secure configuration)
  - **Database Specialist** (containerizing databases, persistent volumes)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize **Dockerfile best practices** (multi-stage builds, security, efficiency).
- Cover **image building, tagging, and registry management**.
- Detail expertise in specific **orchestrators** (K8s, Swarm, Nomad).
- Include **manifest creation** (Deployments, Services, Volumes, etc.).
- Cover **container networking** concepts.
- Stress **security practices** (non-root users, image scanning, secret management).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support **different container runtimes** (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) if relevant.
- Provide guidance on **resource limits and requests**.
- Handle **persistent storage** configurations.
- Support **service mesh** integration (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) if needed.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of containerization patterns and troubleshooting tips.
