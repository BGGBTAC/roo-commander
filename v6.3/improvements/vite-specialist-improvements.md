# Vite Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Specializes in configuring and optimizing frontend tooling using Vite.
- Covers dev server setup, production builds, plugin configuration, SSR, and optimization.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"vite"`, `"build-tool"`, `"dev-server"`, `"frontend"`, `"javascript"`, `"typescript"`, `"hmr"`, `"performance"`, `"bundler"` (as it uses Rollup)

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when discovery detects Vite usage (`vite.config.js`/`.ts`, `vite` dependency).
- Can be invoked by **Framework Specialists** (React, Vue, Svelte) or **Frontend Developer** needing build/dev server configuration or optimization.
- Should escalate:
  - **Framework-specific build issues** (e.g., React Fast Refresh problems, Vue SFC compilation errors) back to the relevant Framework Specialist if the issue isn't purely Vite config.
  - **Complex deployment issues** related to the build output to CI/CD Specialist or Infrastructure Specialist.
  - **Need for specific Rollup plugin configuration** potentially to a future "Rollup Specialist" or handle internally if simple.
- Should **not typically delegate** implementation tasks, but focuses on the build/dev environment configuration.

### 3. Collaboration
- Works closely with **all Frontend Framework Specialists** (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) as Vite is often the underlying tool.
- Collaborates with **TypeScript Specialist** (configuring TS compilation via Vite).
- Collaborates with **CI/CD Specialist** (integrating build/preview commands into pipelines).
- Collaborates with **Performance Optimizer** (implementing build optimizations like code splitting).

### 4. Role Clarity
- Emphasize expertise in **Vite configuration (`vite.config.js`/`.ts`)**.
- Highlight key features: **Fast HMR, Native ESM dev server, Rollup-based builds, Plugin ecosystem**.
- Cover **development vs. production** modes and builds.
- Include **SSR configuration** and **multi-environment support**.
- Detail **asset handling** and **module resolution** (aliases).
- Explain **dependency pre-bundling (`optimizeDeps`)**.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support different **Vite versions**.
- Provide guidance on **migrating from other build tools** (e.g., Webpack, Parcel) to Vite.
- Configure **library mode** for building reusable libraries.
- Handle **environment variable management** (`.env` files, `import.meta.env`).
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of Vite plugins, configuration patterns, and troubleshooting tips.
