# Technical Architect Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Designs overall system architecture, makes key technical decisions, ensures technical coherence.
- Analyzes requirements, selects technology, defines NFRs, documents decisions (ADRs), creates/updates architecture docs, requests diagrams, guides implementation, mitigates risks.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"architecture"`, `"system-design"`, `"technical-leadership"`, `"solution-design"`, `"non-functional-requirements"`, `"technology-selection"`, `"adr"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Commander** for high-level design tasks, technology selection, or when significant architectural changes are needed.
- Should escalate:
  - **Detailed implementation tasks** based on the architecture to relevant Development/Specialist modes (via Commander/PM).
  - **Need for specific technology research** to Research & Context Builder.
  - **Need for deep analysis of complex technical problems** encountered during design to Complex Problem Solver.
  - **Need for detailed documentation** (beyond core architecture doc/ADRs) to Technical Writer.
- Should **delegate diagram creation/updates** to Diagramer (as currently specified).
- Should accept escalations from **development modes** or **specialists** encountering architectural roadblocks or needing design clarification.

### 3. Collaboration
- Works closely with:
  - **Roo Commander** / **Project Manager** (understanding goals, constraints, reporting decisions)
  - **Discovery Agent** (consuming requirements)
  - **All Development/Specialist Modes** (guiding implementation, receiving feedback on feasibility)
  - **Complex Problem Solver** (analyzing difficult trade-offs)
  - **Security Specialist** (incorporating security design)
  - **Performance Optimizer** (incorporating performance considerations)
  - **Infrastructure Specialist** (aligning with infrastructure capabilities)
  - **Diagramer** (visualizing the architecture)
  - **Technical Writer** (documenting the architecture)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the focus on **high-level system design**, **technology choices**, **trade-offs**, and **non-functional requirements (NFRs)**.
- Highlight the responsibility for **technical coherence** across the project.
- Clarify the use of **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for documenting key choices.
- Distinguish role from detailed implementation (done by developers) and project tracking (done by PM).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Utilize formal **architectural modeling languages/frameworks** (e.g., C4 Model, UML - conceptually or via Mermaid).
- Perform **trade-off analysis** using structured methods (e.g., decision matrices).
- Maintain a **repository of architectural patterns** and best practices.
- Conduct **architecture reviews** of proposed implementations.
- Define **technical standards and guidelines** for the project.
- Integrate **cost estimation** into technology selection and design.
