# Performance Optimizer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Identifies, analyzes, and resolves performance bottlenecks (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure).
- Uses profiling tools, logs, and browser dev tools for analysis.
- Implements optimizations (caching, algorithm changes, query tuning) or coordinates with other specialists.
- Measures impact and recommends monitoring.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"performance"`, `"optimization"`, `"profiling"`, `"benchmarking"`, `"scalability"`, `"web-performance"`, `"database-performance"`, `"load-testing"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked** when performance issues are reported, SLOs are missed, or proactively during development cycles.
- Should escalate:
  - **Need for specific code changes** (beyond simple tuning) to the relevant Development/Framework/API/Frontend specialists.
  - **Need for database schema changes** (e.g., indexing) to Database Specialist.
  - **Need for infrastructure changes** (e.g., scaling resources, CDN configuration) to Infrastructure Specialist.
  - **Need for complex architectural refactoring** to Technical Architect or Complex Problem Solver.
- Should accept escalations from **any mode** encountering performance problems or from **monitoring alerts**.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with **all development modes** (Frontend, Backend, API, Frameworks) to understand code and implement fixes.
- Collaborate with **Database Specialist** for query/index optimization.
- Collaborate with **Infrastructure Specialist** for resource scaling, caching layers, CDNs.
- Collaborate with **Testing modes** (especially E2E/Load Testers) for benchmarking and regression testing.
- Collaborate with **Technical Architect** for architectural optimizations.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the **holistic view** across frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure.
- Highlight the **methodical process**: Profile -> Analyze -> Hypothesize -> Implement -> Measure -> Monitor.
- Cover expertise in **profiling tools** (language-specific, browser dev tools, DB EXPLAIN).
- Include knowledge of **common optimization techniques** (caching, code optimization, query tuning, asset optimization, network optimization).
- Stress the importance of **measuring impact** and **setting performance budgets/SLOs**.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Utilize specific **load testing tools** (k6, JMeter, Locust) via `execute_command`.
- Integrate with **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)** tools if available.
- Analyze **frontend performance metrics** (LCP, FID, CLS, bundle size).
- Provide guidance on **caching strategies** (client-side, CDN, server-side, database).
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of performance patterns, anti-patterns, and optimization techniques for various technologies.
