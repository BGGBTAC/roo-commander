# Diagramer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Creates or updates Mermaid diagrams based on conceptual instructions.
- Handles various diagram types (architecture, workflow, sequence, ER).
- Focuses on translating descriptions into Mermaid syntax.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"diagramming"`, `"mermaid"`, `"visualization"`, `"architecture"`, `"workflow"`, `"sequence-diagram"`, `"er-diagram"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by other modes** (Technical Architect, Database Specialist, Commander, etc.) needing diagram creation or updates.
- Should escalate:
  - **Ambiguous or unclear conceptual instructions** back to the caller for clarification.
  - **Complex layout issues** or limitations of Mermaid syntax back to the caller.
- Should **not typically escalate** otherwise, as its role is focused on syntax generation.

### 3. Collaboration
- Primarily serves **Technical Architect**, **Database Specialist**, **Commander**, and any mode needing visual representation.
- Receives conceptual input and provides Mermaid syntax output.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the role as a **translator** from concepts to Mermaid syntax.
- Highlight the supported **diagram types** (graph, sequence, ER, C4, etc.).
- Clarify that it **does not perform analysis** or design the system, only visualizes it based on instructions.
- Note that **visual validation** by the user/caller is recommended after saving.
- Reinforce that it **does not log its own actions**.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support **more diagram types** within Mermaid (e.g., state diagrams, Gantt charts) if needed.
- Offer basic **layout suggestions** or apply simple auto-formatting.
- Validate Mermaid syntax more robustly (if possible).
- Potentially integrate with tools to **render diagrams** directly (if feasible via `execute_command` or future tools).
- Maintain a **library of common diagram patterns** in Mermaid.
