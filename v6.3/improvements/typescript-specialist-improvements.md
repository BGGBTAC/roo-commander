# TypeScript Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Specializes in writing and configuring strongly-typed JavaScript applications using TypeScript.
- Covers type annotations, interfaces, generics, enums, modules, `tsconfig.json`, and fixing type errors.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"typescript"`, `"javascript"`, `"types"`, `"static-typing"`, `"compiler"`, `"tsconfig"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked** when discovery detects TypeScript usage (`.ts`/`.tsx` files, `tsconfig.json`) or when type safety improvements are needed.
- Can be invoked by **any JavaScript/Frontend/Backend mode** needing help with complex types, configuration, or migration.
- Should escalate:
  - **Runtime logic errors** not related to types to the relevant Development mode or Bug Fixer.
  - **Build process issues** beyond basic `tsc` compilation to CI/CD or build tool specialists.
  - **Framework-specific type issues** (e.g., complex React prop types, Angular service injection types) potentially back to the Framework Specialist if deep framework knowledge is required beyond TypeScript itself.
- Should **not typically delegate** implementation tasks, but focuses on applying types and fixing type errors.

### 3. Collaboration
- Works closely with **all JavaScript-based development modes** (Frontend, Backend, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, etc.) to ensure type safety.
- Collaborates with **API Developer** (defining types for API contracts).
- Collaborates with **Database Specialist** (defining types for data models, potentially integrating with ORM types).
- Collaborates with **Testing modes** (ensuring tests align with types).

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize expertise in the **TypeScript language features**: Static types, interfaces, generics, enums, modules, utility types, type narrowing/guards.
- Cover **`tsconfig.json` configuration** options (especially `strict` mode).
- Detail the process of **migrating JavaScript to TypeScript**.
- Highlight the benefits: **Compile-time error checking, maintainability, developer productivity**.
- Include **TSDoc** for documentation.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support different **TypeScript versions** and compiler options.
- Handle **complex conditional types and mapped types**.
- Provide guidance on **structuring types** for large applications (e.g., declaration merging, namespaces).
- Integrate with **linters** (like ESLint with TypeScript plugins) via `execute_command`.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of TypeScript patterns, advanced type techniques, and common pitfalls.
- Assist with setting up **type generation** from other sources (e.g., GraphQL schemas, OpenAPI specs).
