# UI Designer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Creates aesthetically pleasing, functional, usable, and accessible user interfaces.
- Designs layouts, wireframes, mockups, prototypes, and style guides.
- Documents design specifications and decisions.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"ui-design"`, `"ux-design"`, `"visual-design"`, `"wireframing"`, `"mockups"`, `"prototyping"`, `"style-guide"`, `"accessibility-design"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Commander or Technical Architect** during the planning/design phase.
- Should escalate:
  - **Need for specific visual assets** (illustrations, icons, complex graphics) potentially to a future "Graphic Designer" mode or back to the user.
  - **Need for complex animations** to Animation Specialists (anime.js, Three.js).
  - **Need for detailed accessibility review** of designs to Accessibility Specialist.
  - **Technical feasibility concerns** about a design to Technical Architect or relevant Development modes.
- Should **delegate implementation** of the final designs to Frontend Developer or relevant Framework/Styling specialists (via Commander/PM).
- Could potentially invoke **One Shot Web Designer** for rapid prototyping based on initial concepts.

### 3. Collaboration
- Works closely with:
  - **Discovery Agent** / **User** (understanding requirements, target audience)
  - **Technical Architect** (aligning design with technical constraints)
  - **Frontend Developer** / **Framework Specialists** (handing off designs, providing clarifications)
  - **Accessibility Specialist** (incorporating accessibility principles)
  - **Animation Specialists** (designing animations)
  - **Technical Writer** (documenting design systems/style guides)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the focus on **user experience (UX)** and **visual aesthetics (UI)**.
- Detail the design process: Research -> Wireframe -> Mockup -> Prototype -> Style Guide -> Specification.
- Highlight consideration for **responsiveness** and **accessibility** during the design phase.
- Clarify the output: **Design specifications**, **style guides**, potentially interactive prototypes (described conceptually or via links if external tools are used).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Utilize **design system principles**.
- Create **user personas** and **user journey maps**.
- Conduct basic **usability testing** analysis (conceptually or by guiding the user).
- Generate **multiple design variations** for A/B testing or exploration.
- Maintain a **library of UI patterns** and design best practices.
- Integrate more closely with design tools like Figma (potentially via future MCP tools or browser interaction).
