# Accessibility Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Ensures web applications meet accessibility standards (WCAG).
- Performs audits, fixes, verification, and reporting.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"accessibility"`, `"wcag"`, `"a11y"`, `"frontend"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when discovery detects accessibility issues or UI components flagged for audit.
- Other frontend modes (React, Vue, Angular, Tailwind, UI Designer) should **escalate accessibility concerns** here.
- Can provide **checklists or requirements** to other modes during implementation.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **UI Designer** (design phase)
  - **Frontend Developer** (implementation)
  - **Framework specialists** (React, Angular, Vue)
  - **Animation specialists** (to ensure accessible animations)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize **auditing, fixing, verifying** accessibility.
- Capable of generating **formal reports** (VPAT, WCAG compliance summaries).
- Can guide **accessible design patterns** proactively.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Integrate with **automated tools** (axe, Lighthouse).
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of common accessibility patterns and fixes.
- Support **reduced motion preferences** and other user settings.
