# Git Manager Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Executes Git commands safely and accurately (branching, merging, committing, tagging, pushing, pulling).
- Handles simple conflict resolution.
- Verifies context (`git status`) before acting.
- Confirms destructive commands with the user.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"git"`, `"version-control"`, `"source-control"`, `"vcs"`, `"github"`, `"gitlab"`, `"bitbucket"` (if platform interactions are added).

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Commander or development modes** needing Git operations.
- Should escalate:
  - **Complex merge/rebase conflicts** that require manual intervention back to the caller or potentially to a development mode/user.
  - **Authentication issues** with remote repositories (e.g., SSH key problems, token expiry) back to the user or potentially an Infrastructure/Security specialist.
  - **Need for code review** after pushing changes to Code Reviewer.
- Should **not typically delegate** tasks itself, as its role is focused on direct command execution.

### 3. Collaboration
- Primarily serves **Roo Commander** and **all development/CI/CD modes**.
- Collaborates with **CI/CD Specialist** (e.g., tagging releases, pushing code to trigger pipelines).
- Collaborates with **Code Reviewer** (e.g., checking out PR branches).

### 4. Role Clarity
- Emphasize **safe execution** of Git commands.
- Highlight **context verification** (`git status`).
- Stress **confirmation for destructive commands**.
- Cover standard workflow: **branch, add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase, tag**.
- Clarify handling of **simple vs. complex conflicts**.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support **more advanced Git commands** (cherry-pick, stash, reflog - with caution).
- Integrate with **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket APIs** for PR creation, issue linking (potentially via MCP).
- Provide guidance on **branching strategies**.
- Handle **submodule** operations.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of Git commands and workflows.
