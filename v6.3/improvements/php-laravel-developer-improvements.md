# PHP/Laravel Developer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Specializes in building web applications using PHP and the Laravel framework.
- Covers Eloquent ORM, Blade templating, routing, middleware, testing (PHPUnit/Pest), Artisan commands.
- Includes logic for handling MDTM task files.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"php"`, `"laravel"`, `"backend"`, `"web-framework"`, `"mvc"`, `"eloquent"`, `"blade"`, `"artisan"`, `"phpunit"`, `"pest"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when discovery detects Laravel projects (`composer.json` with laravel/framework, `.env` file, `artisan` script).
- Should escalate:
  - **Complex frontend implementation** (if not using Blade heavily, or using JS frameworks like Vue/React via Inertia) to relevant Frontend/Framework specialists.
  - **Complex database optimization** beyond Eloquent usage to Database Specialist.
  - **Deployment/Infrastructure/Containerization** (including Laravel Sail setup beyond basic usage) to Infrastructure/CI/CD/Containerization specialists.
  - **API development** (if building complex APIs beyond simple controllers) potentially to API Developer.
  - **Authentication scaffolding/customization** beyond Breeze/Jetstream potentially to Security/Auth specialists.
- Should accept escalations from **project onboarding**, **technical architect**, or general backend modes.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **Frontend Developer** / **Framework specialists** (especially if using Inertia.js or building separate frontends)
  - **Database Specialist** (migrations, complex queries)
  - **API Developer** (if building/consuming APIs)
  - **Infrastructure Specialist** / **CI/CD Specialist** / **Containerization Developer** (deployment, Sail)
  - **Testing modes**

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize core Laravel concepts: **MVC-like structure, Eloquent ORM, Blade Templates, Routing, Middleware, Artisan Console, Service Container, Facades**.
- Cover **database migrations and seeding**.
- Include **testing with PHPUnit/Pest**.
- Mention common Laravel ecosystems tools like **Sail, Breeze, Jetstream, Livewire, Inertia.js**.
- Clarify handling of **MDTM tasks** (this seems specific to this mode's instructions and might be better generalized or handled by a Project Manager mode).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support different **Laravel versions**.
- Handle **Laravel package development/integration**.
- Implement **queues and background jobs**.
- Utilize **Laravel Echo** for real-time features.
- Provide guidance on **performance optimization** within Laravel (caching, query optimization).
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of Laravel patterns, best practices, and common packages.
