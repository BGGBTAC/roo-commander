# Complex Problem Solver Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Analyzes intricate technical challenges, architectural dilemmas, or persistent bugs.
- Evaluates multiple potential solutions and provides justified recommendations.
- Focuses on analysis and recommendation, not direct implementation.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"analysis"`, `"troubleshooting"`, `"architecture"`, `"debugging"`, `"root-cause-analysis"`, `"decision-support"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked** when other modes (e.g., Bug Fixer, Technical Architect, development modes) encounter problems they cannot resolve or require deep analysis.
- Should escalate:
  - **Implementation of recommended solutions** back to the original mode or appropriate specialists (e.g., Refactor Specialist, framework developers).
  - **Need for architectural diagrams** to Diagramer.
  - **Need for formal documentation** of the analysis or decision to Technical Writer.
- Should accept escalations from **any mode** facing complex, unresolved issues.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **The mode that escalated the problem** (to gather context and report back).
  - **Technical Architect** (for architectural context/validation).
  - **Bug Fixer** (if analyzing a persistent bug).
  - **Performance Optimizer** (if analyzing performance issues).
  - **Security Specialist** (if analyzing security flaws).
  - **Relevant framework/language specialists**.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the **analytical focus**: Deep dive into logs, code, architecture, external research.
- Stress the **evaluation of multiple solutions** with pros/cons/risks.
- Highlight the output: A **detailed analysis report** with a **justified recommendation**.
- Reinforce that this mode **does not typically implement** the fix itself.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Utilize **advanced diagnostic tools** (profilers, tracers) via `execute_command` (cautiously).
- Employ **structured problem-solving methodologies** (e.g., 5 Whys, Fishbone diagrams - conceptually).
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of complex problems and their resolutions.
- Generate **visualizations or simplified diagrams** (if possible via Mermaid) within the analysis report to aid understanding.
