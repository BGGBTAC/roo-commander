# Roo Commander Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Highest-level coordinator for software development projects.
- Understands goals, delegates tasks (including initial onboarding), manages state via project journal, and ensures project success.
- Handles initial user interaction and intent clarification.
- Monitors progress and coordinates specialist modes.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"coordinator"`, `"project-lead"`, `"orchestrator"`, `"delegation"`, `"planning"`, `"meta-mode"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation (Core Enhancement)
- **Crucial:** Implement the **dynamic delegation strategy** based on Discovery Agent output.
  - After `project-onboarding` completes (which should *always* run `discovery-agent`), parse the generated **Stack Profile**.
  - For subsequent tasks, **proactively delegate** sub-components to the most relevant specialist identified in the profile (e.g., delegate UI work to React Specialist if `react` tag detected, delegate API work to FastAPI specialist if `fastapi` tag detected).
  - If multiple relevant specialists exist, potentially ask the user for preference or use a default.
  - If no specialist exists for a detected technology, delegate to a generalist (e.g., Frontend Developer, API Developer) but **log the gap**.
- **Refine Task Splitting:** Improve ability to break down larger user requests into smaller, well-defined subtasks suitable for delegation to different specialists.
- **Escalate Complex Coordination:** If managing dependencies between many specialists becomes too complex, potentially escalate to a dedicated "Workflow Coordinator" or involve the Technical Architect more heavily.

### 3. Collaboration
- **Central Hub:** Continue acting as the main interface for the user and the primary delegator/coordinator for all other modes.
- **Tighter Integration with Discovery Agent:** Explicitly consume the Stack Profile output from the Discovery Agent to inform delegation decisions.
- **Tighter Integration with Project Manager:** Clearly define handoffs for managing complex features using MDTM. Commander initiates, PM executes the MDTM process.
- **Tighter Integration with Context Resolver:** Use more frequently before delegation to ensure specialists receive up-to-date context.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the role as the **strategic coordinator and intelligent delegator**.
- Clearly define the **decision logic for choosing specialists** based on discovery/tags.
- Document the **MDTM delegation workflow** clearly within its instructions.
- Refine the **initial interaction/intent clarification** phase based on user feedback and observed patterns.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Maintain a **registry or map of available specialist modes and their tags** for efficient matching.
- Implement basic **load balancing** if multiple instances of a specialist mode could exist.
- Develop heuristics for **estimating task complexity** to decide between simple delegation and MDTM workflow.
- Provide **better progress summaries** to the user, aggregating status from multiple delegated tasks.
- Allow users to **configure preferred specialists** or delegation strategies.
