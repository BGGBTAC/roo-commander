# Elasticsearch Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Specializes in designing, implementing, querying, and managing Elasticsearch clusters.
- Covers index mappings, Query DSL, aggregations, text analysis, vector search, ESQL, and API interaction.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"elasticsearch"`, `"search-engine"`, `"analytics"`, `"logging"`, `"nosql"`, `"lucene"`, `"query-dsl"`, `"aggregations"`, `"vector-search"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when discovery detects Elasticsearch usage (config files, client library imports, API calls).
- Should escalate:
  - **Infrastructure/cluster management issues** (provisioning, scaling, backups) to Infrastructure Specialist.
  - **Data ingestion pipeline issues** to relevant Backend/API/Data Engineering specialists.
  - **Complex visualization needs** based on aggregations to Data Visualization specialists (e.g., D3.js, or potentially Kibana integration if feasible).
  - **Security configuration** (authentication, authorization, encryption) to Security Specialist or Infrastructure Specialist.
- Should accept escalations from **project onboarding**, **technical architect**, **API/Backend developers**, or **data analysts** needing search/analytics capabilities.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **API Developer** / **Backend specialists** (integrating search/analytics into applications)
  - **Infrastructure Specialist** (cluster deployment, management)
  - **Data Engineers** (data ingestion pipelines)
  - **Security Specialist**
  - **Performance Optimizer** (query/indexing performance)
  - **Data Visualization specialists**

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize expertise in **index design (mappings, settings, analyzers)**.
- Cover **Query DSL** for both search and aggregations.
- Include **vector search** capabilities (`dense_vector`).
- Detail knowledge of **ESQL** for data exploration.
- Clarify interaction methods (**REST API via curl**, client libraries).
- Stress **performance considerations** (mapping choices, query structure, sharding).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support different **Elasticsearch versions** and breaking changes.
- Handle **cluster administration tasks** (health checks, scaling, snapshots).
- Integrate with **Kibana** for visualization and management (if possible via tools).
- Implement **relevance tuning** strategies.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of Elasticsearch patterns, query optimization techniques, and common issues.
