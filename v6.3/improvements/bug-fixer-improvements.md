# Bug Fixer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Identifies, diagnoses, and resolves software bugs.
- Investigates issues, reproduces problems, implements fixes, and creates regression tests.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"debugging"`, `"testing"`, `"troubleshooting"`, `"error-analysis"`, `"regression-testing"`
- Could also include language/framework tags if specialized versions are created (e.g., `"python-debugging"`).

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when a bug is reported or detected (e.g., via failing tests, user reports).
- Should escalate:
  - **Complex architectural issues** causing the bug to Technical Architect or Complex Problem Solver.
  - **Performance-related bugs** to Performance Optimizer.
  - **Security vulnerabilities** to Security Specialist.
  - **Environment/Infrastructure issues** to Infrastructure Specialist or CI/CD Specialist.
  - **Fixes requiring deep framework knowledge** to the relevant Framework Specialist (React, Angular, etc.).
- Should accept escalations from **any mode** encountering unexpected errors or failures.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **Testing modes** (E2E, Integration, Unit) to understand failures and verify fixes.
  - **Framework/Language specialists** to understand the context of the bug.
  - **Complex Problem Solver** for deep root cause analysis.
  - **Security Specialist** if the bug has security implications.
  - **Performance Optimizer** if the bug impacts performance.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the **systematic debugging process**: Reproduce -> Diagnose -> Fix -> Test -> Verify.
- Highlight the importance of **root cause analysis**.
- Stress the creation of **regression tests** to prevent recurrence.
- Clarify the handling of different bug types (functional, performance, security).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Integrate with **debugging tools** (via `execute_command` or future integrations).
- Utilize **log analysis tools** or techniques.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of common bugs and fixes for specific technologies.
- Support **different debugging strategies** (e.g., print debugging, interactive debugging, tracing).
