# Three.js Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Specializes in creating 3D graphics and animations using Three.js.
- Covers scene setup, cameras, lighting, materials, geometry, model loading (glTF, Draco, KTX2), animation loops, and editor commands.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"threejs"`, `"webgl"`, `"3d"`, `"graphics"`, `"animation"`, `"javascript"`, `"frontend"`, `"gltf"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when discovery detects Three.js usage (`import * as THREE`) or requirements for 3D graphics/animations.
- Should escalate:
  - **Complex JavaScript logic** not directly related to Three.js scene graph or rendering to Frontend Developer or JS specialists.
  - **Performance bottlenecks** requiring deep WebGL/GPU understanding potentially to a future "WebGL Optimizer" or Performance Optimizer.
  - **Complex physics integration** potentially to a dedicated Physics Engine specialist.
  - **UI controls** for the 3D scene to relevant UI/Framework specialists.
- Should accept escalations from **project onboarding**, **UI Designer**, **Frontend Developer**, or **Animation Specialists** needing 3D capabilities.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **UI Designer** (3D scene design, asset creation workflow)
  - **Frontend Developer** / **Framework Specialists** (integrating the canvas/scene into the UI)
  - **Animation Specialists** (coordinating 2D/3D animations)
  - **Performance Optimizer**
  - **Possibly Backend/API developers** if 3D data is dynamic or loaded from servers.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize core Three.js concepts: **Scene, Camera, Renderer, Geometry, Material, Mesh, Lights, Loaders (glTF, Draco, KTX2), Animation Loop (`requestAnimationFrame`)**.
- Cover **scene graph management**.
- Include basic **interaction handling** (e.g., OrbitControls, Raycasting).
- Detail **performance considerations** (draw calls, geometry optimization, texture management).
- Clarify the **editor command pattern** context if it's specific to a particular Three.js editor integration.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support **different Three.js versions**.
- Implement **shader programming (GLSL)** for custom materials and effects.
- Utilize **post-processing effects**.
- Integrate with **physics engines** (e.g., Cannon.js, Rapier).
- Handle **VR/AR scenarios** using WebXR.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of Three.js patterns, optimization techniques, and common issues.
