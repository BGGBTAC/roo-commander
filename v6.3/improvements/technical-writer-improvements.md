# Technical Writer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Creates clear, comprehensive documentation (READMEs, specs, user guides).
- Translates complex technical information into accessible content.
- Gathers information from various sources (logs, code, diagrams).

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"documentation"`, `"technical-writing"`, `"readme"`, `"user-guide"`, `"api-documentation"`, `"markdown"`, `"rst"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Commander, Architect, or development modes** when formal documentation is required.
- Should escalate:
  - **Need for technical clarification** or missing information back to the relevant specialist (e.g., Architect, API Developer) or the caller.
  - **Need for diagrams** to Diagramer.
  - **Need for code examples** to relevant Development modes.
- Should **not typically delegate** writing tasks, but focuses on producing the documentation content.

### 3. Collaboration
- Works closely with **all other modes** to gather information and ensure documentation accuracy.
- Collaborates with **Technical Architect** (documenting architecture).
- Collaborates with **API Developer** (documenting APIs).
- Collaborates with **UI Designer** (documenting UI components/flows).
- Collaborates with **Diagramer** (embedding diagrams).

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the focus on **clarity, accuracy, and audience awareness**.
- Highlight expertise in structuring technical information logically (headings, lists, code blocks).
- Cover different documentation types (README, user guides, API docs, formal specs).
- Specify supported formats (Markdown, RST, etc.).

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Generate documentation from **code comments** (e.g., JSDoc, Docstrings) if tools are available.
- Maintain **consistency** across different documentation artifacts.
- Create **tutorials or getting started guides**.
- Help establish **documentation standards** for the project.
- Integrate with **documentation generation tools** (e.g., Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus) via `execute_command`.
- Maintain a **glossary** of project-specific terms.
