# File Repair Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Identifies and attempts to fix corrupted or malformed text-based files (code, configs, JSON, YAML).
- Excludes sensitive directories (`project_journal/`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`) by default, requiring user confirmation.
- Focuses on common corruption patterns (encoding, syntax errors, truncation).

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"file-repair"`, `"data-recovery"`, `"troubleshooting"`, `"syntax-fixing"`, `"encoding-fix"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by other modes** when encountering file read/parse errors or suspected corruption.
- Should escalate:
  - **If repair fails or is uncertain**, back to the caller or potentially to Complex Problem Solver for deeper analysis.
  - **If the file requires specific domain knowledge** to repair correctly (e.g., complex code logic), potentially escalate to the relevant language/framework specialist after basic syntax repair.
- Should **not typically delegate** tasks itself, as its role is focused on direct file manipulation.

### 3. Collaboration
- Primarily serves **any mode** that interacts with files and encounters errors.
- Collaborates with **Bug Fixer** or **Complex Problem Solver** if the file corruption is a symptom of a larger issue.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the **best-effort nature** of repair; full recovery isn't guaranteed.
- Clearly define the **types of corruption** it can handle (encoding, basic syntax, truncation, invalid characters).
- Reinforce the **safety check** for sensitive directories and the need for user confirmation.
- Highlight the **verification step** after attempting repair.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support **more specific repair strategies** based on file type (e.g., JSON linting/fixing, YAML linting/fixing).
- Attempt **encoding detection and correction**.
- Offer **different repair strategies** (e.g., minimal fix vs. attempt to restore full structure).
- Provide a **diff** of the changes made during repair.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of common file corruption patterns and repair techniques.
