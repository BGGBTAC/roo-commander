# Mode Maker Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Guides users through creating *new* custom mode definition files (`.json`).
- Helps define mode name, slug, role, instructions, and tool groups via iterative questions.
- Saves the resulting JSON file.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"mode-creation"`, `"meta-programming"`, `"configuration"`, `"json"`, `"roo-system"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Roo Commander** when a user requests to create a new mode.
- Should escalate:
  - **Requests for complex custom instructions** or workflows potentially to Technical Writer or a future "Workflow Designer" mode.
  - **Need for generating context indices** for the new mode to Context Condenser.
- Should **not typically delegate** tasks itself, as its role is focused on guided creation.

### 3. Collaboration
- Primarily interacts with the **User** and **Roo Commander**.
- Collaborates indirectly with **Context Condenser** (by potentially requesting indices to be included in the new mode's instructions).
- Collaborates with **Mode Maintainer** (as the created mode might later be maintained).

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the role as a **guided creator** for *new* modes.
- Clearly explain the purpose of each field (`slug`, `name`, `roleDefinition`, `customInstructions`, `groups`).
- Highlight the default inclusion of all tool `groups` unless restrictions are needed.
- Stress the importance of **unique slugs**.
- Reinforce the need for **valid JSON** output.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Provide **templates or examples** for different types of modes (e.g., specialist, coordinator, agent).
- Offer suggestions for `roleDefinition` or `customInstructions` based on the mode's intended purpose.
- Integrate **JSON validation** check before saving.
- Automatically suggest adding **standard operational principles** to `customInstructions`.
- Potentially integrate with **Git Manager** to commit the new mode file.
- Guide users on **testing** the newly created mode.
