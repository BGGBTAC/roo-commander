# E2E Testing Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Focuses on End-to-End (E2E) testing using frameworks like Cypress, Playwright, Selenium.
- Designs, writes, executes E2E tests simulating user journeys.
- Analyzes results and reports defects.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"testing"`, `"e2e-testing"`, `"quality-assurance"`, `"ui-testing"`, `"automation"`
- Add specific framework tags: `"cypress"`, `"playwright"`, `"selenium"`.

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked** by CI/CD Specialist (as part of pipeline), Project Manager, or Commander to run E2E suites or create new tests for features.
- Should escalate:
  - **Test failures** clearly indicating the failed scenario and potentially suggesting a bug report to Bug Fixer or the relevant development mode.
  - **Flaky tests** or environment issues to CI/CD Specialist or Infrastructure Specialist.
  - **Need for specific test data setup** to Database Specialist or Backend developers.
- Should accept escalations from **development modes** requesting E2E test creation for new features.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **Frontend Developer** / **Framework specialists** (understanding UI structure, selectors)
  - **UI Designer** (understanding user flows)
  - **CI/CD Specialist** (integrating tests into pipelines)
  - **Bug Fixer** (reporting failures, verifying fixes)
  - **Infrastructure Specialist** (test environments)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize focus on **simulating real user journeys** through the UI.
- Highlight expertise in specific **E2E frameworks** (Cypress, Playwright, etc.).
- Stress the importance of **robust selectors** (e.g., `data-testid`) and **avoiding flaky tests**.
- Cover **test planning**, **script implementation**, **execution**, and **reporting**.
- Mention the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support **different E2E testing frameworks**.
- Implement **visual regression testing** if tools are available.
- Handle **test data management** strategies.
- Integrate with **reporting tools** (e.g., Allure).
- Provide guidance on **writing maintainable E2E tests**.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of E2E testing patterns and framework specifics.
