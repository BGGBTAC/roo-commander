# Mode Maintainer Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Applies instructed modifications to existing custom mode definition files (`.json`).
- Follows provided guidance, SOPs, or specific change requests.
- Includes steps for checking file existence, gathering context, planning changes, applying modifications, validating JSON, and saving.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"mode-management"`, `"configuration"`, `"json"`, `"meta-programming"`, `"roo-system"`

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **invoked by Roo Commander** or potentially a future "Mode Architect" when updates to existing modes are needed.
- Should escalate:
  - **Ambiguous or conflicting instructions** back to the caller for clarification.
  - **Invalid JSON errors** after modification attempts back to the caller (potentially suggesting manual review or using a JSON validator tool if available).
  - **Requests requiring significant architectural changes** to mode design back to the caller or a Mode Architect.
- Should **not typically delegate** tasks itself, as its role is focused on applying specific, instructed changes.

### 3. Collaboration
- Primarily serves **Roo Commander** or a **Mode Architect**.
- Collaborates indirectly with **Context Condenser** by potentially incorporating generated indices into `customInstructions`.
- Collaborates with **Technical Writer** if mode documentation needs updating alongside the definition file.

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize the role as an **executor of specific, instructed changes** to mode JSON files.
- Highlight the importance of **JSON validation** before saving.
- Clarify the process: Read -> Plan -> Modify (in memory) -> Validate -> Write.
- Reinforce adherence to `ROO_COMMANDER_SYSTEM.md` guidelines if mentioned.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Integrate with a **JSON validation tool** via `execute_command` if available and safe.
- Support **batch updates** across multiple mode files based on a common instruction set.
- Offer **diff previews** of changes before saving (potentially using `apply_diff` in a dry-run mode if possible, or generating a diff manually).
- Maintain a **changelog** for mode modifications (potentially by appending to a central log file).
