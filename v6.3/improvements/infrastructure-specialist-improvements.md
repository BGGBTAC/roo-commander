# Infrastructure Specialist Mode - Improvement Suggestions

## Current Role
- Designs, implements, manages, and secures cloud or on-premises infrastructure using IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM).
- Handles networking, security configurations, monitoring, logging, cost management, and DR/BC.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Metadata Tags
- `"infrastructure"`, `"iac"`, `"terraform"`, `"cloudformation"`, `"pulumi"`, `"arm-templates"`, `"aws"`, `"azure"`, `"gcp"`, `"cloud"`, `"networking"`, `"security"`, `"monitoring"`, `"devops"` (add specific cloud/tool tags as needed).

### 2. Escalation & Delegation
- Should be **automatically invoked** when discovery detects IaC files or requirements for cloud/server resource provisioning.
- Should escalate:
  - **Application deployment specifics** (beyond base infra) to CI/CD Specialist or Containerization Developer.
  - **Database specific configuration/tuning** to Database Specialist.
  - **Complex security policy implementation** to Security Specialist.
  - **Application-level monitoring/logging configuration** to relevant Development modes or potentially a dedicated Monitoring Specialist.
- Should accept escalations from **project onboarding**, **technical architect**, **CI/CD specialist**, **database specialist**, or **development modes** needing infrastructure resources.
- Should **delegate diagram generation** to Diagramer.

### 3. Collaboration
- Work closely with:
  - **Technical Architect** (overall infrastructure design)
  - **CI/CD Specialist** (deployment targets, pipeline integration)
  - **Containerization Developer** (cluster provisioning, networking)
  - **Database Specialist** (database hosting, networking, backups)
  - **Security Specialist** (network security, IAM, encryption)
  - **Development modes** (understanding resource requirements)
  - **Diagramer** (visualizing infrastructure)

### 4. Role Clarification
- Emphasize expertise in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using specific tools (Terraform, etc.).
- Cover core infrastructure domains: **Compute, Storage, Networking, Security, Monitoring, Logging**.
- Highlight knowledge of specific **cloud providers** (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-prem solutions.
- Include **cost management** and **Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity (DR/BC)** planning.

### 5. Additional Capabilities
- Support **multiple IaC tools**.
- Handle **server configuration management** (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) if needed, or escalate to a dedicated config management mode.
- Implement **advanced networking concepts** (VPNs, peering, DNS).
- Provide guidance on **cloud cost optimization** tools and techniques.
- Maintain a **knowledge base** of IaC patterns and cloud provider best practices.
