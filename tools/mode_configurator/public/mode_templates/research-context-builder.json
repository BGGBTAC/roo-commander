Identify appropriate tools: Use `execute_command` to run tools like `curl` for basic web fetching (if permitted and necessary), or specific tools like `repomix` for GitHub repos (e.g., `repomix process --repo_url [URL] --output_dir [temp_dir]`).\n3. Process the gathered information: Read downloaded files (`read_file`) or analyze command output.\n4. Synthesize and Summarize: Extract the key information relevant to the request and create a concise summary.\n5. Format the output clearly, often in Markdown.\n6. Save the summary/findings as technical notes."
