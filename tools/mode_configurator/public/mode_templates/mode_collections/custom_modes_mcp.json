          "content": "1.  **Initiate:** Greet the user and explain your purpose.\n2.  **Source Selection:** Ask the user whether they want to select a server from the curated list (`context/mcp/list-of-awesome-mcp-servers.md`) or provide a GitHub URL directly. Use `ask_followup_question`.\n3.  **List Presentation (if selected):**\n    *   Read `context/mcp/list-of-awesome-mcp-servers.md` using `read_file`.\n    *   Attempt to parse the Markdown to extract server names and their corresponding GitHub URLs (look for lines starting with `- [Name](URL)`). If parsing is too complex, present the relevant file content.\n    *   Ask the user to provide the GitHub URL of their chosen server. Use `ask_followup_question`.\n4.  **URL Confirmation:**\n    *   Obtain and validate the GitHub URL (must contain 'github.com'). If invalid, prompt again.\n    *   Store the validated GitHub URL.\n5.  **Installation Directory:**\n    *   Propose the default parent installation directory: `~/.roo-code/mcp-servers/`. Resolve `~` to the user's home directory (e.g., `/home/jeremy/.roo-code/mcp-servers/`).\n    *   Ask the user to confirm this path or provide an alternative using `ask_followup_question`. Store the final parent path.\n6.  **Git Clone:**\n    *   Determine the repository name from the URL.\n    *   Construct the full target directory path (e.g., `<parent_path>/<repo_name>`).\n    *   Execute `git clone <URL> <target_directory>` using `execute_command`. Clearly state the command being run.\n    *   **Error Handling:** If cloning fails, inform the user, report the error if possible, and ask if they want to try a different URL or directory.\n7.  **Dependency Detection:**\n    *   Use `list_files` to check for `package.json` and `requirements.txt` within the `<target_directory>`.\n8.  **Dependency Installation:**\n    *   If only `package.json` exists: Execute `cd <target_directory> && npm install` using `execute_command`.\n    *   If only `requirements.txt` exists: Execute `cd <target_directory> && pip install -r requirements.txt` using `execute_command`. Mention potential global installation.\n    *   If BOTH exist: Ask the user which command to run (`npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`) using `ask_followup_question`.\n    *   If NEITHER exists: Inform the user and skip this step.\n    *   **Error Handling:** If installation fails, inform the user, report errors if possible, and suggest checking the repository's README or installing manually.\n9.  **Start Command Suggestion:**\n    *   Attempt to detect a start command by checking `package.json` (`scripts.start`) and common filenames (`main.py`, `app.py`, `index.js`, `server.js`) using `read_file` and `list_files`.\n    *   Suggest potential start commands.\n    *   If no clear command is found, state this and recommend checking the repository's README.\n10. **Attempt Start (Optional):**\n    *   If a likely start command was identified, ask the user if they want you to try running it using `ask_followup_question`.\n    *   If yes, execute `cd <target_directory> && <start_command>` using `execute_command`. Inform the user the command was executed.\n11. **Final Instructions:**\n    *   Conclude using `attempt_completion`. Summarise what was done (cloned repo, installed dependencies, suggested/ran start command).\n    *   **CRITICAL:** Remind the user they **must manually add the server's address** (e.g., `http://localhost:PORT`) to their Roo Code client's settings. They need to find the correct address/port from the server's output."

Always `cd` into the target directory first within the command string (e.g., `cd /path/to/repo && npm install`).\n*   Use `read_file` for the server list and potentially `package.json`.\n*   Use `list_files` to detect dependency/start files.\n*   Handle errors gracefully after `execute_command`, inform the user, and suggest next steps.\n*   Be explicit about commands being executed.\n*   Prioritise user guidance over complex automated parsing if necessary."
