# Workflow: Migrate Mode from v7.1 to .modes/ Structure (v1.11)

## 1. Objective üéØ
*   To migrate a single mode definition from the v7.1 directory structure to the new `.modes/` structure, applying predefined naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content (with an interactive option to generate basic KB if missing/insufficient), creating mode-specific rules, generating an **enhanced KB README**, updating the central manifest, and **enforcing the standard mode template structure**, maximizing delegation.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
*   Applies to each individual mode located within the `v7.1/modes/` directory structure.
*   Covers identifying source files, looking up naming/paths, **populating the standard mode template** using source data, handling potentially empty source KBs, generating an enhanced KB README, delegating verification, and delegating manifest updates.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   (No change from v1.10)

## 4. Preconditionsüö¶
*   (No change from v1.10)

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools üìöüõ†Ô∏è
*   (No change from v1.10)

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   (No change)

*   **Step 2: Delegate Source Read & Validation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change)

*   **Step 3: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   (No change)

*   **Step 4: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change)

*   **Step 5: Delegate Mode Definition Migration using Template (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v1.10 - already uses standard template path)

*   **Step 6: Delegate KB Content Migration & Optional Population (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent, potentially involves User interaction)**
    *   (No change from v1.10 - includes refined "Generate basic KB" instruction)

*   **Step 7: Delegate Enhanced KB README Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v1.10)

*   **Step 8: Delegate KB Rule Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v1.10 - uses enhanced rule template)

*   **Step 9: Delegate Manifest Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change)

*   **Step 10: Delegate Verification (Coordinator delegates to Verification Agent)**
    *   (No change from v1.10 - already checks template structure)

*   **Step 11: Delegate Tracking File Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Action:** Instruct a Worker Agent (e.g., `technical-writer` or `mode-maintainer`) to update the `.context/mode_migration_status_v71_to_v72.md` file.
    *   **Details:** Mark the current mode as "Migrated", add the completion date, and any relevant notes (e.g., "KB generated", "Emoji updated").
    *   **Tool:** `apply_diff` or `search_and_replace`.

*   **Step 12: Delegate Archiving of v7.1 Source (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Action:** Instruct a Worker Agent (e.g., `git-manager` or `mode-maintainer`) to move the original v7.1 mode directory to the archive.
    *   **Details:** Use `execute_command` with `mkdir -p` for the target archive path (preserving structure) and `mv` for the source directory. Example: `mkdir -p v7.1/modes/.archive/<original_path_structure>/ && mv <original_v7.1_mode_path> v7.1/modes/.archive/<original_path_structure>/`
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`.

*   **Step 13: Final Report (Coordinator Task)**
    *   (No change)

## 7. Postconditions ‚úÖ

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ‚ö†Ô∏è
*   (No change from v1.10)

*   v1.10 (2025-04-18): Updated Step 5 to enforce population of the standard template. Updated verification check 3.
*   v1.9 (2025-04-18): Refined the "Generate basic KB" instruction in Step 6b.
*   v1.8 (2025-04-18): Modified Step 6b prompt to offer "Generate basic KB content". Updated Step 7 and 10.
*   v1.7 (2025-04-18): Enhanced Step 7 (README generation) and Step 8 (KB lookup rule). Adjusted verification check 5.
*   v1.6 (2025-04-18): Added Step 6b to handle empty/insufficient source KBs. Adjusted Step 7 and Verification Step 10. Added context agents.
*   v1.5 (2025-04-18): Updated Step 3 to use mapping doc. Updated references. Status back to draft.
*   v1.4 (2025-04-18): Changed target dir to `.modes/`. Refined naming. Added Step 7 (KB README). Updated paths. Status back to draft.
*   v1.3 (2025-04-18): Delegated source read/validation and manifest update. Renumbered steps. Added KB rule template.
