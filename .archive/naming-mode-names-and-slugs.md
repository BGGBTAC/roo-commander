ok we did a full run through and

ok that looks fairly good but id like to review the workflow because the slug name has turned out a lot longer than i expected it would, eg we had part of our workflow like  **Adopt a new naming convention:** Use a `role-topic` or `area-specialty` format (e.g., `core-code`, `manager-projects`, `lead-backend`, `dev-angular`, `design-ui`)

but this is the folder we ended up with
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/assistant-context-discovery-agent
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/v7.2/assistant-context-discovery-agent

remember we had a chat about the prefixes>? do we need to define more and then make sure they are a distinct part of the workflow>?

Naming Prefixes: Please review the proposed prefixes:

core- (code, ask, debug, architect, commander)
manager- (projects, products)
lead- (backend, frontend, design, devops, qa, security, db)
dev- (angular, react, python, fastapi, django, php, vue, sveltekit, nextjs, etc.)
design- (ui, mui, shadcn, bootstrap, tailwind, d3, threejs)
data- (sql, mongo, dbt, elasticsearch, mysql, neon)
test- (e2e, integration)
infra- (docker, aws, gcp, azure, cloudflare)
util- (git, writer, reviewer, eslint, vite)
agent- (discovery, research)
spec- (directus, frappe, wordpress, clerk, supabase-auth, firebase-auth, openai, huggingface) - Using spec- for platform/API-specific roles.
Do these prefixes cover the existing modes well? Any adjustments needed?

is there anything else from our discussions that we have forgotten to include?
and i think we should make the 
.modes/mode-slug
(note i decided we will make the folder .modes not .mode

folder structure with all the context instead of making the v7.2 folder

and then when we make the 

.roo/rules-mode-slug

it will be able to reference to the folder we are going to be using in production

also i think we should check the readme.md that is in the kb folder after all the files are added to get it updated
