Q: How would we manage mode versions or logical groupings (e.g., frontend, backend, utility) in a flat structure? We might need a separate manifest file (e.g., .mode/manifest.toml) to track mode metadata, versions, and relationships.

A: we will make a manifest file, and that will be part of the information availble to all the modes to lookup and each mode will have a subset of that as part of their context so they know who they are usually delegating to and if its a multi agent workflow or task then they can lookup the sub agents from the manifest and work out what agents are going to likely be required. Clear naming will be helpful. also i forsee that some time in the future be in a database, so by doing it this way it will not be so difficult to transition to that. also it lets us include in the readme file some external links that the mode could consult if it wants to as well.

Q: Mechanism: The core challenge is how a mode determines which KB files are relevant for a given task. This requires a well-defined mechanism. Will it be based on keywords in the task? A predefined index in kb/README.md? Will the mode itself need sophisticated logic, or will the underlying system handle KB retrieval? This needs careful design to be effective and reliable.

A: I agree, and i think that this is where we work out a clever prompt that lets the mode self assess based on what it has been asked to do as to what part of its kb would be helpful. It should still be able to fuinction even without kb input but its about increasing its specific knowledge to help keep it focused, and also there could be new information not in its training data for example. it cant be rigid rules, we will need to give the most independence to decide based on some factors you can work out a good prompt.

Q: We need a well-defined and consistently applied set of prefixes (e.g., core-, manager-, lead-, dev-, design-, data-, test-, infra-, util-).

A: i agree, lets discuss this in more detail and be confident, your suggestions sound ok to me, and i think actually even that short word helps with the context for the ai and human as to what the mode is for


Q: This is a significant architectural change. I recommend we create a formal proposal or ADR (Architecture Decision Record) in the .decisions/ folder to document the chosen path, rationale, and implementation plan before starting the work.

A: absolutely, there is no rush, we should plan this out very carefully.


What else should we consider if anything?
