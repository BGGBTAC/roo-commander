Okay, let's build out a detailed proposal for implementing **"Confidence-Assessed Development" leading to "Risk-Appropriate Review/Testing"** within Roo Code's agentic framework. This proposal aims to be clear enough for you to explain to Roo Commander and other AI agents.

**Proposal: Implementing Confidence-Assessed Development & Risk-Appropriate QA**

**1. Core Concept:**

We are establishing a standard operational procedure where AI-generated code is automatically assessed for potential risk (expressed as an internal "Confidence Score"). This score, combined with a user-defined "Caution Level," dictates the level of automated review and testing (QA) applied before the code is finalized or presented to the user. This applies recursively to tasks delegated to sub-agents.

**Analogy:** Think of it like a tiered peer review system. Simple, standard code ("High Confidence") gets a quick check. More complex or uncertain code ("Medium/Low Confidence") triggers more thorough reviews or even requests for testing, depending on how careful the user wants the system to be ("Caution Level").

**2. Goals:**

*   **Improve Reliability:** Proactively catch potential errors, logical flaws, or omissions introduced during AI generation.
*   **Increase User Trust:** Provide transparency about the QA steps taken and offer configurable levels of assurance.
*   **Manage Complexity:** Apply more scrutiny to more complex or ambiguous tasks where errors are more likely.
*   **Optimize Workflow:** Balance QA overhead with development speed based on user preference and assessed risk.
*   **Standardize Process:** Create a consistent, teachable workflow for all agents involved in code generation and modification.

**3. Core Components:**

*   **Agent Roles (in this context):**
    *   **Roo Commander:** The primary orchestrator. Receives user requests, assigns tasks, manages the overall QA workflow, makes final decisions on QA actions based on confidence/caution, integrates feedback, communicates with the user.
    *   **Developer Agent(s):** Responsible for generating or modifying code based on a specific task. Critically, they are *also* responsible for performing the initial Confidence Assessment on their *own* output before returning it. When delegating, they act as the 'Commander' for their sub-agents.
    *   **Reviewer Agent:** A specialized agent prompted to analyze code provided by another agent. It checks for logic flaws, adherence to instructions, potential bugs, style consistency, and missing error handling based on the required QA level.
    *   **Tester Agent (Optional/Advanced):** A specialized agent (or a mode of the Reviewer) activated for low-confidence/high-caution scenarios. It focuses on identifying edge cases, suggesting test inputs, and potentially generating basic test structures (e.g., Jest/Vitest stubs).
*   **Confidence Score:**
    *   **Nature:** An internal, calculated heuristic (e.g., Low, Medium, High) representing the estimated likelihood of the generated code being correct and complete *for the specific task*. It is *not* a guarantee but a risk indicator.
    *   **Calculation:** Performed by the agent completing the task (e.g., Developer Agent) *before* submitting the result. It considers:
        *   **Task Analysis:** Complexity (keywords, length), Ambiguity (vague terms, missing details), Novelty (standard pattern vs. unique logic).
        *   **Code Analysis:** Length, Structural Complexity (e.g., nesting, cyclomatic complexity estimation), Presence of Error Handling, Use of Risky Patterns (if detectable), Number of external dependencies/imports touched.
        *   **(Optional) Generation Process:** Were multiple internal attempts needed? Did the model express low probability during generation? (If accessible).
*   **User Caution Level:**
    *   **Nature:** A user-defined setting determining the desired level of automated QA overhead versus speed.
    *   **Levels (Example):**
        *   `Minimal`: Fastest. Assumes user takes full review responsibility. Only triggers QA on `Low` confidence. Basic linting only.
        *   `Balanced` (**Default**): Good mix. Triggers Reviewer Agent for `Medium` and `Low` confidence. Standard review checks.
        *   `Thorough`: Highest assurance. Triggers Reviewer Agent for `Medium` and `Low` confidence, potentially with stricter checks. Triggers Tester Agent/Checks for `Low` confidence.
    *   **Setting:**
        *   **Default:** `Balanced`.
        *   **Initial Assessment:** Roo Commander could infer a suitable starting level based on initial user interactions, project type analysis, or explicit questions during onboarding ("How cautious should Roo Code be about checking its work? Fast, Balanced, or Thorough?").
        *   **Configuration:** Stored in a project preferences file.. we could store things like the users name, preferred tech stack and experience level, persona etc in there too?
*   **QA Actions:** Specific automated steps triggered by the workflow logic.
    *   Linting/Formatting (Basic check, always on or tied to Minimal).
    *   AI Peer Review (Standard checks by Reviewer Agent).
    *   Intensive AI Peer Review (Stricter checks by Reviewer Agent).
    *   Edge Case Analysis / Test Suggestion (by Tester Agent/Mode).
    *   Flag for Human Review (Explicit message to user for very low confidence/critical tasks).

**4. The Confidence-Assessed Workflow (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Request:** User issues a request to Roo Commander.
2.  **Initial Assessment (Commander):** Commander analyzes the request for initial complexity/criticality to inform task assignment. Determines the active `User Caution Level`.
3.  **Task Assignment:** Commander assigns the task (potentially broken down) to a Developer Agent, providing the prompt, relevant context (files, project info), and the active `User Caution Level`.
4.  **--- Agent Execution Cycle (Developer Agent) ---**
    *   **a. Understand Task:** Agent processes the prompt and context.
    *   **b. *Delegation Point (If Needed):***
        *   If the Agent needs to delegate a sub-task:
            *   It acts as a 'Commander' for the sub-task.
            *   It assigns the sub-task to another sub-agent.
            *   The sub-agent executes steps `a` to `f` (below).
            *   The delegating Agent receives the result (code + confidence score) from the sub-agent, performs step `g` (Feedback Integration) for the sub-task result, and then continues its own work.
    *   **c. Generate/Modify Code:** Agent performs the core coding task.
    *   **d. Self-Assess Confidence:** Agent runs the internal Confidence Scoring logic on the generated code and the original task requirements. Assigns `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`.
    *   **e. Package Result:** Agent bundles the generated code, the final Confidence Score, a brief rationale for the score (optional but helpful), and any necessary context.
    *   **f. Report to Commander:** Agent sends the packaged result back to its Commander (either the main Roo Commander or the delegating Agent).
5.  **--- QA Decision & Execution Cycle (Commander) ---**
    *   **a. Receive Result:** Commander receives the package (code + confidence score).
    *   **b. Decision Logic:** Commander evaluates `Confidence Score` against `User Caution Level`:
        *   `High` Confidence: Usually proceed to step `g` (unless `Caution == Thorough` might trigger a light review).
        *   `Medium` Confidence & (`Caution == Balanced` OR `Caution == Thorough`): Trigger AI Peer Review (Assign to Reviewer Agent).
        *   `Low` Confidence & (`Caution == Minimal`): Proceed to step `g` (user accepts risk).
        *   `Low` Confidence & `Caution == Balanced`: Trigger AI Peer Review.
        *   `Low` Confidence & `Caution == Thorough`: Trigger Intensive AI Peer Review AND/OR Tester Agent checks. Possibly flag for human review.
    *   **c. Delegate QA Task (If Triggered):** Commander assigns review/testing task to appropriate agent(s), providing code, original prompt, confidence score, and specific instructions based on the required QA level.
    *   **d. Receive QA Feedback:** Commander receives analysis/feedback from Reviewer/Tester Agent(s).
    *   **e. Critically Analyze Feedback:** Commander assesses if the feedback is valid, significant, and requires code changes. (Avoids trivial changes or loops).
    *   **f. Initiate Revision (If Needed):** If changes are needed, Commander sends the code and specific revision instructions back to the Developer Agent (goto step 4.a, but with clearer revision task).
6.  **--- Finalization ---**
    *   **g. Integrate & Finalize:** Once QA is complete (or skipped) and any necessary revisions are done, Commander finalizes the code/result.
    *   **h. Report to User:** Commander presents the final result to the user, potentially including a summary of the Confidence Score and QA steps taken (e.g., "Generated code with Medium confidence, reviewed by AI peer.").

**5. Implementation Considerations:**

*   **Confidence Scoring Module:** Develop as a reusable utility accessible by all agents. Start with simple heuristics (LOC, basic error handling checks, keywords in prompt) and iterate based on performance.
*   **Agent Prompting:** Carefully craft the base prompts for each agent role, explicitly including instructions for their part in this QA workflow (e.g., Dev agent *must* return a confidence score; Reviewer agent *must* check for X, Y, Z based on input).
*   **Configuration:** Implement the `User Caution Level` setting (e.g., VS Code settings API, `.roo-config.json`). Design the initial user interaction for setting/inferring this.
*   **Transparency:** Ensure UI elements clearly communicate the confidence and QA status to the user.

**6. Benefits of this Approach:**

*   Builds a proactive quality gate directly into the development process.
*   Adapts QA effort to the perceived risk, saving time on simple tasks.
*   Empowers users to control the trade-off between speed and assurance.
*   Provides a scalable framework for handling complex tasks and delegation.
*   Creates a traceable record of automated QA actions.

**7. Next Steps:**

*   Develop the initial Confidence Scoring logic (start simple).
*   Define the precise checks for the Reviewer Agent under "Balanced" caution.
*   Implement the `User Caution Level` setting with "Balanced" as default.
*   Modify Roo Commander and Developer Agent prompts/logic to incorporate the basic workflow (Steps 1-5 using Low/Medium/High and Balanced).
*   Test and iterate based on results.

This detailed proposal provides a blueprint for integrating automated, risk-aware QA into Roo Code's agentic development process, directly addressing your goal of ensuring reliability in a complex, delegated workflow.
