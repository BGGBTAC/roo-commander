# Workflow: Create Roo Commander Distribution Builds

## 1. Objective üéØ
*   To create various Roo Commander distribution builds (Complete, Kilocode, Collections) in isolated temporary directories.
*   To ensure build processes do not modify the main workspace.
*   To verify the presence of build artifacts before cleaning up temporary files.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
*   This workflow is triggered manually when temporary, isolated builds are needed (e.g., for testing, previews). It does *not* create official releases or modify the Git history.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Initiates the workflow, executes commands via the Executor.
*   **Executor (Terminal):** Runs the directory creation, build script, verification, and cleanup commands provided by the Coordinator.

## 4. Preconditionsüö¶
*   Necessary tools (`node`, standard shell commands like `mkdir`, `ls`, `rm`) are available.
*   Build scripts (`scripts/create_build.js`, `scripts/create_kilocode_build.js`, `scripts/run_collection_builds.js`) exist and are functional.
*   *(Assumption)* Build scripts accept an output directory argument (e.g., `--output <path>`) or reliably place output in a predictable location relative to execution.

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools üìöüõ†Ô∏è
*   `scripts/create_build.js`
*   `scripts/create_kilocode_build.js`
*   `scripts/run_collection_builds.js`
*   `execute_command`: Tool to run shell commands and Node.js scripts.
*   `list_files` (Optional): Alternative tool for verification.

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Setup Temporary Directories (Coordinator delegates to Executor via `execute_command`)**
    *   **Description:** Create the temporary directories for the builds.
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`
    *   **Command Example (Linux/macOS):** `mkdir -p ./tmp_build ./tmp_kilocode ./tmp_collections`
    *   **Validation:** Check for exit code 0.
    *   **Error Handling:** If creation fails, check permissions. Report failure.

*   **Step 2: Execute Complete Build (Coordinator delegates to Executor via `execute_command`)**
    *   **Description:** Run the script to create the complete build in its temporary directory.
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`
    *   **Command Example:** `node scripts/create_build.js --output ./tmp_build/` (Note: Adjust command based on actual script arguments if `--output` is not supported)
    *   **Validation:** Check for exit code 0 and success messages from the script.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the script fails, analyze its output. Check dependencies, paths. Report failure.

*   **Step 3: Execute Kilocode Build (Coordinator delegates to Executor via `execute_command`)**
    *   **Description:** Run the script to create the Kilocode build in its temporary directory.
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`
    *   **Command Example:** `node scripts/create_kilocode_build.js --output ./tmp_kilocode/` (Note: Adjust command based on actual script arguments if `--output` is not supported)
    *   **Validation:** Check for exit code 0 and success messages from the script.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the script fails, analyze its output. Check dependencies, paths. Report failure.

*   **Step 4: Execute Collection Builds (Coordinator delegates to Executor via `execute_command`)**
    *   **Description:** Run the script to create the collection builds in their temporary directory.
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`
    *   **Command Example:** `node scripts/run_collection_builds.js --output ./tmp_collections/` (Note: Adjust command based on actual script arguments if `--output` is not supported)
    *   **Validation:** Check for exit code 0 and success messages from the script.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the script fails, analyze its output. Check dependencies, paths. Report failure.

*   **Step 5: Verify Build Artifacts (Coordinator delegates to Executor via `execute_command`)**
    *   **Description:** Check if the expected primary build artifacts exist in the temporary directories. This step is crucial before cleanup.
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`
    *   **Command Example (Linux/macOS using `ls`):**
        ```bash
        echo "Verifying builds..." && \
        ls ./tmp_build/*.zip && \
        ls ./tmp_kilocode/*.zip && \
        ls ./tmp_collections/*.zip && \
        echo "Verification successful."
        # Adjust *.zip patterns based on actual expected output filenames/types if needed.
        ```
    *   **Alternative Command (Linux/macOS using `test`):**
        ```bash
        echo "Verifying builds..." && \
        test -f ./tmp_build/expected_complete.zip && \
        test -f ./tmp_kilocode/expected_kilocode.zip && \
        test -f ./tmp_collections/expected_collection1.zip && \
        echo "Verification successful."
        # Add more specific 'test -f' checks for key files as needed.
        ```
    *   **Validation:** Check for exit code 0 (indicates all commands succeeded). Non-zero indicates failure. Review output for specific errors (e.g., "No such file or directory").
    *   **Error Handling:** If verification fails, report which artifacts appear missing based on the command output. **Crucially, do not proceed to the cleanup step.**

*   **Step 6: Cleanup Temporary Directories (Coordinator delegates to Executor via `execute_command`)**
    *   **Description:** Remove the temporary directories *only if* verification in Step 5 was successful.
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`
    *   **Command Example (Linux/macOS):** `rm -rf ./tmp_build ./tmp_kilocode ./tmp_collections`
    *   **Validation:** Check for exit code 0.
    *   **Error Handling:** If cleanup fails, check permissions or if files are locked. Report failure.

## 7. Postconditions ‚úÖ
*   Build artifacts were successfully generated in temporary directories (and subsequently removed after successful verification).
*   The main workspace directory remains unmodified by the build process.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ‚ö†Ô∏è
*   If directory creation fails, check permissions.
*   If any build script fails, analyze its output. Check script dependencies and paths.
*   If verification fails, investigate the relevant build script's execution and output. **Do not clean up temporary directories.** Report the failure.
*   If cleanup fails (after successful verification), check permissions or if files are locked. Report the issue.
*   Escalate to the user if steps fail and cannot be resolved.
