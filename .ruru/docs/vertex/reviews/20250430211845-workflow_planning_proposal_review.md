# Analysis of Workflow: WF-PLANNING-PROPOSAL-V1

## Strengths

1.  **Structured Definition:** The workflow utilizes a consistent structure across all step files (Metadata, Flow Control, Execution, Interface, Housekeeping, Actions, Acceptance Criteria, Error Handling). This promotes readability and maintainability. The use of TOML-like frontmatter combined with Markdown is clear.
2.  **Clear Step Separation:** Each step has a distinct purpose (Initiation, Refinement, Whitepaper Gen, Impl Docs Gen, Finish/Verify), contributing to modularity and understanding the overall process.
3.  **Explicit Dependencies and Flow:** The `depends_on`, `next_step`, and `error_step` fields clearly define the intended sequence and basic error flow, making the workflow's path easy to follow. Dependencies appear correctly specified for a linear process.
4.  **Defined Inputs/Outputs:** Each step explicitly lists its expected inputs and generated outputs, including references to outputs from previous steps. This aids in understanding data flow and dependencies between steps. The format "Output from step X: variable_name" is helpful.
5.  **Role Delegation:** The `delegate_to` field clearly assigns responsibility for core step logic (e.g., `ask`, `technical-writer`, `project-manager`), indicating a design potentially leveraging specialized agents or modes.
6.  **Action Descriptions:** The `Actions` sections provide reasonably clear, step-by-step instructions for the entity executing the step (orchestrator or delegate).
7.  **Acceptance Criteria:** Each step includes `Acceptance Criteria`, providing a basic checklist for verifying successful completion of that specific step.
8.  **Basic Error Handling Defined:** Every step includes an `Error Handling` section outlining potential failure points and the general consequence (typically proceeding to the `99_finish` step).
9.  **README Overview:** The `README.md` provides a good high-level summary of the workflow's purpose, overall inputs, and expected final outputs, aligning well with the defined steps.

## Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement

1.  **Ambiguity in `proposal_name` Generation (Clarity/Correctness):** Step 00 states "Determine a concise, filesystem-safe `proposal_name`" but lacks specific rules or methods for how this determination occurs (e.g., based on user input sanitization, prompting the user, using a timestamp). This could lead to inconsistent or undesirable naming.
2.  **Ambiguity in File Handling (Clarity/Potential Issues):**
    *   Step 00, Action 5 mentions verifying existence but doesn't specify behavior if files *don't* exist (fail immediately? warn? proceed without?). The error handling note suggests asking a follow-up *or* failing, which introduces uncertainty in the flow.
    *   The workflow doesn't explicitly address potential filename collisions within the `input_path` if the user provides multiple files with the same name.
    *   It doesn't define behavior if a `proposal_name` leads to a directory that already exists (potential for overwriting or merging content unintentionally). `mkdir -p` handles directory creation safely, but subsequent `write_to_file` actions might overwrite.
3.  **Undefined Confirmation Mechanism (Clarity/Potential Issues):** Steps 01, 02, and 03 mention "*Confirmation required before write*" for `write_to_file`. The mechanism for this confirmation (User prompt? Orchestrator internal check? Delegate capability?) is undefined, potentially introducing blocking behavior or ambiguity in execution.
4.  **Vagueness in Refinement Interaction (Clarity/Potential Issues):** Step 01 mentions using `ask_followup_question` but doesn't define the interaction's limits or exit conditions beyond "user is unresponsive." What constitutes unresponsiveness (timeout?) is unclear. There's no mechanism described for iterative refinement or user rejection of the summary.
5.  **Implementation Document Specificity (Clarity/Completeness):** Step 03 lists examples (`Implementation_Plan.md`, `Concerns_Analysis.md`) but doesn't mandate specific documents. The output `implementation_docs_paths` is a list, but the required *content* or *minimum set* of documents isn't strictly defined, potentially leading to variability.
6.  **Input/Output Variable Consistency (Clarity):**
    *   Step 00 lists "Saved initial input files within input_path" as an output description, but not as a named variable. Step 01 inputs this implicitly via `input_path`. A more explicit output variable (e.g., `initial_input_artifacts_list`) might improve clarity.
    *   The specific file `initial_request.md` (mentioned in Step 00 Actions) isn't explicitly listed as an output artifact or checked individually in Step 99, though its *directory* is checked.
7.  **Lack of Review/Approval Loop (Completeness/Potential Issues):** The workflow generates documents but lacks any steps for user review or approval of the generated whitepaper or implementation documents before finishing. This might be insufficient for a real-world planning process.
8.  **Error Reporting Granularity (Error Handling):** While steps direct to `99_finish` on error, the `99_finish` step primarily focuses on *missing* artifacts. It's not explicitly clear how detailed the error reporting would be for *failures during generation* (e.g., delegate errors in steps 01, 02, 03) beyond just logging a failure.

## Suggestions

1.  **Specify `proposal_name` Generation:** Define clear rules in Step 00 Actions for how `proposal_name` is derived and sanitized (e.g., "Sanitize the first 30 characters of the user request title, replacing spaces with underscores and removing non-alphanumeric characters").
2.  **Clarify File Handling Rules:**
    *   In Step 00, explicitly state the behavior if user-provided files don't exist (e.g., "Fail the step if required files are missing," or "Log a warning and continue if files are optional"). Resolve the ambiguity between failing and asking follow-up.
    *   Define behavior for duplicate input filenames.
    *   Specify behavior if the target `proposal_base_path` already exists (e.g., "Fail if exists," "Append timestamp," "Require user confirmation to overwrite").
3.  **Define Confirmation Mechanism:** Specify *how* the "*Confirmation required before write*" is handled for `write_to_file` actions (e.g., "Delegate must use `confirm_write(path)` tool," or "Orchestrator prompts user before executing `write_to_file`").
4.  **Refine Interaction Definition (Step 01):** Define "user unresponsiveness" (e.g., "Timeout after 2 attempts or 5 minutes"). Consider adding logic or an optional step for user review/acceptance of the `Refinement_Notes.md` before proceeding.
5.  **Specify Implementation Documents (Step 03):** Clearly state which implementation documents are mandatory and which are optional. Update Acceptance Criteria accordingly.
6.  **Improve Input/Output Explicitness:**
    *   Consider adding an explicit output variable in Step 00 listing the paths of the saved initial input files.
    *   Explicitly list `initial_request.md` (if always created) as an expected artifact in Step 99's verification.
7.  **Consider Adding Review Steps:** Introduce optional or mandatory review steps after Step 01 (Refinement Notes), Step 02 (Whitepaper), and/or Step 03 (Implementation Docs) where the user or another stakeholder can approve or request revisions, potentially looping back to the generation step.
8.  **Enhance Error Reporting:** Ensure the `99_finish` step or the orchestrator logic can capture and report not just missing artifacts, but also the specific step and reason for failure if an error occurred during execution (e.g., by passing error details to the `error_step`).
9.  **Add Versioning:** Include the workflow `version` (from `README.md`) in the generated output directory or metadata for traceability.

### Knowledge Limitations

This analysis is based *solely* on the text content provided in the workflow definition files (`README.md` and step files `00` through `99`). It cannot assess:

*   The actual implementation quality or correctness of the underlying orchestrator, delegate modes (`ask`, `technical-writer`, `project-manager`), or tools (`execute_command`, `write_to_file`, etc.).
*   How well the workflow integrates with the broader system (`.ruru/`, `prime-coordinator`).
*   Performance characteristics or potential race conditions.
*   The specific templates (`template_schema_doc`) referenced.
*   Any implicit conventions or capabilities of the execution environment not documented within these files.

The evaluation assumes the descriptions and intended logic within the files accurately reflect the design goals.
