# Analysis of Roo Commander Operational Document Review

This document summarizes the findings from the `util-second-opinion` review of Roo Commander's core operational documents (KB files and specific rules) conducted on 2025-04-20, along with initial recommendations for addressing the identified areas of concern.

## Review Findings & Recommendations

**1. Overlap between Operational Principles and KB Procedures**
    *   **Finding:** High-level guidance in `.roo/rules-roo-commander/01-operational-principles.md` is elaborated upon in multiple KB files, leading to potential redundancy and inconsistency. The hierarchy isn't explicitly clear.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Clearly define the relationship: State explicitly in `01-operational-principles.md` that it provides the *core tenets*, while the KB files contain the *detailed procedures* for implementing those tenets.
        *   Add cross-references: Link specific principles in `01-operational-principles.md` to the relevant KB procedure file(s).
        *   Review for direct contradiction: Ensure no KB procedure directly contradicts a core principle. Minor redundancy might be acceptable if it aids clarity within a specific procedure, but significant overlap should be consolidated.

**2. Fragmented Logging/Journaling Guidance**
    *   **Finding:** Instructions on logging (what, where, how) are distributed across `01-operational-principles.md`, `04-delegation-mdtm.md`, `05-collaboration-escalation.md`, `06-documentation-logging.md`, and `07-safety-protocols.md`.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Consolidate core logging procedures into a single, dedicated KB file (e.g., potentially expanding `06-documentation-logging.md` or creating a new `12-logging-procedures.md`).
        *   This central document should clearly define:
            *   What events trigger logging (decisions, delegations, errors, status updates, etc.).
            *   The standard locations (`.decisions/`, `.tasks/`, `.logs/`, etc.) for different types of logs.
            *   The standard naming conventions for log files/entries.
            *   The appropriate tools (`write_to_file`, `append_to_file`, `insert_content`) for each scenario.
        *   Other documents should then *reference* this central logging procedure instead of repeating parts of it.

**3. Consistency of MDTM Workflow References**
    *   **Finding:** MDTM usage is mentioned in `03-workflow-coordination.md`, `04-delegation-mdtm.md`, and `07-safety-protocols.md`. Consistency in application criteria (simple vs. complex/critical tasks) needs ensuring.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Clearly define the criteria for "Complex/Critical Tasks" requiring MDTM within `04-delegation-mdtm.md`. Use specific examples if possible (e.g., tasks involving multiple steps, cross-mode dependencies, file modifications requiring careful review).
        *   Ensure `03-workflow-coordination.md` and `07-safety-protocols.md` reference the criteria defined in `04-delegation-mdtm.md` when mentioning MDTM, rather than potentially re-interpreting the trigger conditions.

**4. Ambiguity in Workflow vs. Process Distinction**
    *   **Finding:** The distinction between `.workflows/` and `.processes/` is unclear, especially as `09-process-creation-rule.md` suggests using the workflow template for complex processes.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Establish clear definitions:
            *   **Workflow (`.workflows/`):** High-level, potentially multi-role, end-to-end sequences of activities to achieve a significant outcome (e.g., creating a build, onboarding a project). May orchestrate multiple processes.
            *   **Process/SOP (`.processes/`):** Detailed, step-by-step instructions for performing a specific, often repeatable, task or procedure, usually within a single role's domain (e.g., running code quality checks, refactoring a specific pattern).
        *   Update `09-process-creation-rule.md`: Clarify that while the *structure* of the workflow template might be adaptable, the output should be saved in `.processes/` and focus on the granular, procedural steps characteristic of an SOP. Remove or rephrase the suggestion to use the workflow template if it causes confusion.
        *   Review existing files in `.workflows/` and `.processes/` to ensure they align with these definitions.

**5. Consistency in Context Gathering Guidance**
    *   **Finding:** Guidance on using `agent-context-resolver` varies in emphasis (mandatory vs. recommended) across different documents.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Refine guidance to emphasize *situational judgment*. Instead of strict mandatory triggers, provide clear *indicators* suggesting when `agent-context-resolver` is highly beneficial (e.g., high task complexity, ambiguity in requirements, potential impact on multiple components).
        *   Empower modes to decide based on available information and perceived risk/complexity, while strongly encouraging proactive context gathering (`01-operational-principles.md` - "Context is Key").
        *   Consolidate the primary guidance on *when to consider* using the resolver into `01-operational-principles.md` and potentially `03-workflow-coordination.md`, with other documents referencing these primary points.
        *   *(Self-Correction Note: Also review the instructions provided *to* `agent-context-resolver` itself to ensure its operational goals align with this refined guidance).*

**6. Overlap in Error Handling Procedures**
    *   **Finding:** Error handling instructions are split between `05-collaboration-escalation.md` (analysis/decision) and `07-safety-protocols.md` (logging/recovery).
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Merge the core error handling procedure into one primary document, likely `05-collaboration-escalation.md` as it deals with the response to blockers/issues.
        *   This procedure should cover: detection, initial assessment, logging (referencing the central logging procedure), analysis, decision on next steps (retry, alternative approach, escalate), and recovery actions.
        *   `07-safety-protocols.md` can then reference this consolidated error handling procedure as a key safety measure.

**7. Maintenance of Index Files**
    *   **Finding:** The new index files (`10-standard-processes-index.md`, `11-standard-workflows-index.md`) risk becoming outdated.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Add a step to the procedures defined in `08-workflow-creation-rule.md` and `09-process-creation-rule.md` explicitly requiring the author to update the corresponding index file (`11-standard-workflows-index.md` or `10-standard-processes-index.md`) whenever a new workflow or process is created or significantly modified/removed.
        *   Consider periodic automated checks or reminders if feasible, although manual updates tied to the creation process are likely the most practical approach initially.

**8. Clarity on Documentation Ownership/Modification**
    *   **Finding:** The distinction between editing `.planning/` vs. `.docs/` documents, and the use of `write_to_file`, could be clearer.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Refine the rationale in `06-documentation-logging.md`: Explain *why* `.planning/` might allow more direct Commander edits (e.g., iterative nature, less formal structure) while `.docs/` requires more rigor (stability, broader audience, potential need for specialist input).
        *   Clarify the `write_to_file` guidance: Emphasize that `write_to_file` is generally acceptable for *creating new, relatively small* documents (like initial planning drafts or ADRs based on templates), but `apply_diff` or `search_and_replace` are strongly preferred for *modifying existing* documents, especially larger ones, to avoid accidental data loss and improve efficiency.
