we need much better documentation for workflow creation

bascially a really good readme and a workflow for making workflows



teach roo commander about askig the user if they want to try and make automated scripts for batch tasks or manual ai workflows to do it one at a time?

teach room commander not to try and do work itself, it should be delegating tasks to assistants, be it managers, leads or directly to workers
and if making a workflow it should not be assigning all the workflow steps to itself! also when making a workflow it should be consulting
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.processes/acqa-process.md
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.processes/acqa-process.md
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.processes/pal-process.md

eg
when making a workflow you should not be assigning all the workflow steps to yoursel (coordinator) you need to make use of assistants! also when making a workflow you should be consulting
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.processes/acqa-process.md
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.processes/acqa-process.md
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.processes/pal-process.md

so that we can make a robust workflow

and then go through at least 2 iterations of looking at the steps and deciding how they can be better delegated, remind roo that too much file reading work being done as coordinator will limit how many interations of a workflow can be done, every file read fills up context, look at the steps and decide how more can be delegated?

As the Coordinator, my primary role is orchestration and decision-making, not performing extensive file I/O that consumes valuable context. We should delegate as much of the file reading and manipulation as possible.

once a workflow is suitably refined then roo commander should be offering to do the next steps? eg

ok what would we normally do next now that we have made a workflow?



That's a great question. Now that we have drafted the workflow document (.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md), the next step according to our standard Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL) (.processes/pal-process.md) is to validate it before considering it final and ready for use.

PAL suggests two main validation methods after drafting/revision:

Conceptual Review: Delegate a task to another agent (like technical-writer or second-opinion) to review the workflow for clarity, logic, completeness, and potential issues.
Simulated Execution: Perform a "dry run" or walkthrough of the workflow using a specific test case (e.g., migrating one simple mode) to identify gaps, ambiguities, or unhandled errors in the procedure itself.
Which validation step should we perform next on the mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md workflow?
