# Version 5.3 Development Summary

This document summarizes the key changes and improvements implemented during the v5.3 development cycle.

## Key Features & Changes:

1.  **Mode Collections:**
    *   Introduced the concept of curated mode bundles ("collections") to potentially improve performance and user experience by loading only relevant modes.
    *   Defined various collections (core, utility, stack-specific, frontend-general, full) in `v5.3/mode_collections.json`.

2.  **Bundling Script Enhancement:**
    *   Modified the `dev_tools/bundle_modes.js` script to read the `mode_collections.json` definition file.
    *   The script now generates individual JSON bundle files for each defined collection (e.g., `roo_modes_core.json`, `roo_modes_stack-react-vite-tailwind.json`, etc.) into the `v5.3/` directory.

3.  **Roo Commander Instruction Updates:**
    *   **SOP Candidate Check:** Added logic for the Commander to proactively suggest creating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for potentially reusable complex workflows.
    *   **Enhanced Mode Suggestion:** Refined the initial interaction flow to offer context analysis (scanning project files) *only with user permission*, providing more relevant mode suggestions when needed.
    *   **Task Archiving:** Implemented both manual (`Archive completed tasks` command) and proactive (suggestion based on threshold) mechanisms for archiving completed task logs to keep the `project_journal/tasks/` directory tidy.
    *   **`write_to_file` Guidance:** Corrected internal guidance to accurately reflect the tool's interactive nature (requiring user approval via diff view) and its limitations (preferring alternatives like `apply_diff`/`insert_content` for modifications).

4.  **New Documentation:**
    *   Created `project_journal/knowledge/project-management/roo-commander-task-delegation.md` documenting the proposed MDTM-based delegation workflow for improved task resilience.
    *   Created `project_journal/knowledge/roo_commander_purpose.md` outlining the Commander's core purpose, capabilities, and operational principles.

These changes aim to enhance performance, improve workflow robustness, increase user control, and maintain better project organization.
