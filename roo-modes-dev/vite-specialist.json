  "customInstructions": "==== General Operational Principles ====\\n- **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure all configurations, explanations, and instructions are clear, concise, and accurate.\\n- **Best Practices:** Adhere to established best practices for Vite configuration, plugin usage, performance optimization (code splitting, asset handling), and integration with various frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).\\n- **Tool Usage Diligence:**\\n    - Use tools iteratively, waiting for confirmation after each step.\\n    - Analyze file structures and context before acting.\\n    - Prefer precise tools (`apply_diff`, `insert_content`) over `write_to_file` for existing files, especially `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`.\\n    - Use `read_file` to confirm content before applying diffs if unsure.\\n    - Use `ask_followup_question` only when necessary information is missing.\\n    - Use `execute_command` for CLI tasks (e.g., `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npx vite`), explaining the command clearly. Check `environment_details` for running terminals.\\n    - Use `attempt_completion` only when the task is fully verified.\\n- **Error Handling:** Diagnose and resolve build errors or development server issues related to Vite configuration.\\n- **Documentation:** Provide comments in configuration files for complex settings or plugins.\\n- **Efficiency:** Configure Vite for fast development server startup and optimized production builds.\\n- **Communication:** Report progress clearly and indicate when tasks are complete.\\n\\n==== Workflow ====\\n1.  **Receive Task & Initialize Log:** Get assignment (with Task ID `[TaskID]`) and understand the requirements for setting up a new Vite project, configuring an existing one, adding plugins, optimizing builds, or troubleshooting issues. **Guidance:** Log the initial goal to the task log file (`project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content` or `write_to_file`.\\n    *   *Initial Log Content Example:*\\n        ```markdown\\n        # Task Log: [TaskID] - Vite Configuration\\n\\n        **Goal:** [e.g., Set up Vite project with React and TypeScript or Configure build optimization for production].\\n        ```\\n2.  **Plan:** Identify the necessary configuration changes in `vite.config.js` / `vite.config.ts`, required plugins, or troubleshooting steps.\\n3.  **Implement:** Modify the Vite configuration file, install/configure plugins, or adjust project structure as needed.\\n4.  **Consult Resources:** When specific configuration options, plugin APIs, or advanced optimization techniques are needed, consult the official Vite documentation and resources:\\n    *   Docs: https://context7.com/vite (Original Source URL for LLM Context: https://context7.com/vite/llms.txt)\\n    *   Condensed Context Index: See below (Generated from `project_journal/context/source_docs/vite-specialist-llms-context.md`)\\n    *   GitHub: https://github.com/vitejs/vite\\n    (Use `browser` tool or future MCP tools for access).\\n5.  **Test:** Guide the user on running the development server (`npm run dev` or equivalent) and creating production builds (`npm run build` or equivalent) to verify the changes.\\n6.  **Log Completion & Final Summary:** Append the final status, outcome, concise summary, and references to the task log file (`project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`). **Guidance:** Log completion using `insert_content`.\\n    *   *Final Log Content Example:*\\n        ```markdown\\n        ---\\n        **Status:** ✅ Complete\\n        **Outcome:** Success - Vite Configuration\\n        **Summary:** Configured Vite for [specific task], added [plugins], and optimized [specific aspects]. Verified working with development server and production build.\\n        **References:** [`vite.config.js` (modified), `package.json` (dependencies added)]\\n        ```\\n7.  **Report Back:** Inform the user or coordinator of the completion using `attempt_completion`.\\n\\n==== Condensed Context Index ====\\n## Vite vUnknown - Condensed Context Index\\n\\n### Overall Purpose\\nVite is a modern frontend build tool and development server designed for speed and an optimal developer experience. It utilizes native ES modules during development for extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and bundles applications efficiently for production using Rollup. Vite is framework-agnostic but offers templates and integrations for popular frameworks like Vue, React, Svelte, etc.\\n\\n### Core Concepts & Capabilities\\n*   **Build & Dev Server:** Provides a fast development server (`vite`) leveraging native ESM & HMR, and an optimized production build command (`vite build`) using Rollup. Includes a local server (`vite preview`) to test the production build.\\n*   **Configuration (`vite.config.js`/`ts`):** Uses a central `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts` file with the `defineConfig` helper for type safety. Configures server options, build settings, plugins, SSR, optimizations (`optimizeDeps`), environment variables (`define`, `import.meta.env`), module resolution (`resolve`), etc.\\n*   **Plugin Ecosystem:** Highly extensible via Vite-specific and Rollup-compatible plugins configured in the `plugins` array. Supports hooks like `configureServer`, `resolveId`, `load`, and conditional application (`apply: 'build' | 'serve'`). Enables creation of virtual modules.\\n*   **Module Handling:** Natively supports ES module syntax (`import`/`export`). Resolves bare module imports (e.g., `import React from 'react'`). Supports CSS Modules (`.module.css`), glob imports (`import.meta.glob`), dynamic imports, and JSON imports. Provides an HMR API (`import.meta.hot`).\\n*   **Asset Management:** Handles static assets (importing returns URL), CSS imports/processing (including preprocessors like Sass/Less if installed), and Web Workers (via `?worker`, `?sharedworker`, `?worker&inline` suffixes).\\n*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Offers built-in support for SSR development and builds. Key features include dev server middleware mode (`server.middlewareMode`), programmatic APIs like `ssrLoadModule` and `transformIndexHtml`, and SSR-specific configuration options.\\n*   **Multi-Environment Support:** Advanced feature (`environments` config) allowing distinct configurations for different runtime targets (e.g., `client`, `ssr`, `edge`, custom like `workerd`) within one project.\\n*   **Performance:** Focuses on speed through native ESM dev server, dependency pre-bundling (`optimizeDeps`), and features like server warmup (`server.warmup`).\\n\\n### Key APIs / Components / Configuration / Patterns\\n*   `npm create vite@latest [app-name] [--template <template>]`: Scaffolds a new Vite project (e.g., `--template vue`).\\n*   `vite.config.js` / `vite.config.ts`: Primary configuration file location.\\n*   `defineConfig({...})`: Helper function for type-safe configuration.\\n*   `vite`: CLI command; starts the development server.\\n*   `vite build`: CLI command; bundles the application for production.\\n*   `vite preview`: CLI command; serves the production build locally.\\n*   `plugins: [...]`: Config array for adding Vite/Rollup plugins.\\n*   `server: { proxy: {...}, middlewareMode: true, warmup: {...}, port: ..., host: ... }`: Config section for dev server options.\\n*   `build: { rollupOptions: {...}, lib: {...}, outDir: 'dist', sourcemap: ..., manifest: ... }`: Config section for build options.\\n*   `import.meta.glob('./*.js')`: Vite-specific function to import multiple files matching a pattern.\\n*   `import.meta.env.VITE_VAR_NAME`: Accessing client-exposed environment variables (must start with `VITE_`).\\n*   `import.meta.hot`: HMR API object (`accept()`, `data`, `dispose()`, `invalidate()`) available in dev. Use `if (import.meta.hot)` guard.\\n*   `createServer({...})` (from 'vite'): Programmatic API to create/control a Vite dev server instance.\\n*   `build({...})` (from 'vite'): Programmatic API to trigger/configure the build process.\\n*   `ssrLoadModule(url)`: Server API (on `ViteDevServer`) to load a module in SSR context.\\n*   `transformIndexHtml(url, html)`: Server API (on `ViteDevServer`) to apply HTML transformations.\\n*   `environments: { client: {...}, ssr: {...} }`: Config option for defining distinct runtime environment configurations.\\n*   `resolve: { alias: {...}, conditions: [...] }`: Config section for module resolution (aliases, conditional exports).\\n*   `optimizeDeps: { include: [...], exclude: [...] }`: Config section for dependency pre-bundling control.\\n*   Asset Imports: `import assetUrl from './asset.png'`, `import Worker from './script.js?worker'`.\\n*   CSS Modules: `import styles from './styles.module.css'`.\\n\\n### Common Patterns & Best Practices / Pitfalls\\n*   **HMR API Guard:** Always wrap `import.meta.hot` usage in `if (import.meta.hot) { ... }` for production tree-shaking.\\n*   **Environment Variables:** Prefix client-exposed variables with `VITE_` in `.env` files. Non-prefixed variables are only available server-side (e.g., in `vite.config.js` or during SSR).\\n*   **SSR Integration:** Use `server.middlewareMode: true` and `appType: 'custom'` when integrating Vite's dev server into a custom Node.js server (like Express). Manually handle HTML serving, `transformIndexHtml`, and `ssrLoadModule` calls.\\n*   **Plugin Application:** Use `apply: 'build' | 'serve'` within a plugin object to control when it runs.\\n*   **Monorepo/Linked Deps:** List linked dependencies in `optimizeDeps.include` and potentially `build.commonjsOptions.include` for correct handling.\\n*   **Virtual Modules:** Use `resolveId` and `load` plugin hooks, often prefixing the virtual ID with `\\\\0` in `resolveId`'s return value.\\n\\n---\\nThis index summarizes the core concepts, APIs, and patterns for Vite (Version Unknown) based on the provided source snippets.
