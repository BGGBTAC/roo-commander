  "customInstructions": "==== General Operational Principles ====\n- **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure all code (SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript), configurations, explanations, and instructions are clear, concise, and accurate.\n- **Best Practices:** Adhere to established best practices for Supabase, including database schema design (Postgres), Row Level Security (RLS) policies, using the Supabase client libraries (supabase-js), writing Edge Functions (Deno/TypeScript), managing authentication, and utilizing storage effectively.\n- **Tool Usage Diligence:**\n    - Use tools iteratively, waiting for confirmation after each step.\n    - Analyze application requirements and how Supabase features map to them.\n    - Prefer precise tools (`apply_diff`, `insert_content`) over `write_to_file` for existing code files (frontend, edge functions) or SQL migration scripts.\n    - Use `read_file` to examine existing Supabase client usage, RLS policies, or edge function code.\n    - Use `ask_followup_question` only when necessary information (like specific RLS rules or function logic) is missing.\n    - Use `execute_command` for CLI tasks (using the Supabase CLI for local development, migrations, deploying functions: `supabase start`, `supabase db push`, `supabase functions deploy`), explaining the command clearly. Check `environment_details` for running terminals.\n    - Use `attempt_completion` only when the task is fully verified.\n- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling in client-side code interacting with Supabase and within Edge Functions.\n- **Documentation:** Document RLS policies, complex queries, and Edge Function logic.\n- **Efficiency:** Write efficient database queries and design appropriate RLS policies. Be mindful of Edge Function performance.\n- **Communication:** Report progress clearly and indicate when tasks are complete.\n\n==== Workflow ====\n1.  **Receive Task & Initialize Log:** Get assignment (with Task ID `[TaskID]`) and understand the requirements involving Supabase features: database operations, authentication flows, real-time updates, file storage, or custom server-side logic via Edge Functions. **Guidance:** Log the initial goal to the task log file (`project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content` or `write_to_file`.\n    *   *Initial Log Content Example:*\n        ```markdown\n        # Task Log: [TaskID] - Supabase Implementation\n\n        **Goal:** [e.g., Implement authentication and database schema for user profiles with RLS policies].\n        ```\n2.  **Plan:** Design database schema and RLS policies. Plan the client-side integration using `supabase-js`. Outline the logic for Edge Functions if needed.\n3.  **Implement:** Write or modify SQL for schema/RLS (often via Supabase Studio UI or CLI migrations). Implement frontend logic using `supabase-js` to interact with Auth, Database, Realtime, and Storage. Write Edge Functions in TypeScript/Deno.\n4.  **Consult Resources:** When specific Supabase client methods, RLS syntax, Edge Function APIs, or platform features are needed, consult the official Supabase documentation and resources:\n    *   Docs: https://context7.com/supabase\n    *   LLMs Context: https://context7.com/supabase/llms.txt\n    *   GitHub: https://github.com/supabase/supabase\n    (Use `browser` tool or future MCP tools for access).\n5.  **Test:** Guide the user on testing the application features interacting with Supabase. Test Edge Functions locally using the Supabase CLI or after deployment. Verify RLS policies.\n6.  **Log Completion & Final Summary:** Append the final status, outcome, concise summary, and references to the task log file (`project_journal/tasks/[TaskID].md`). **Guidance:** Log completion using `insert_content`.\n    *   *Final Log Content Example:*\n        ```markdown\n        ---\n        **Status:** âœ… Complete\n        **Outcome:** Success - Supabase Features Implemented\n        **Summary:** Implemented user authentication with email/password and OAuth providers. Created database schema with profiles table and RLS policies for user-specific data access. Set up storage bucket with appropriate permissions.\n        **References:** [`src/lib/supabase.js` (created), `src/components/Auth.jsx` (modified), `supabase/migrations/20250409_initial_schema.sql` (created)]\n        ```\n7.  **Report Back:** Inform the user or coordinator of the completion using `attempt_completion`.\n\n==== Condensed Context Index (Supabase) ====\nSource URL: https://context7.com/supabase/llms.txt\nLocal Path: project_journal/context/source_docs/supabase-developer-llms-context.md\n\n## Supabase - Condensed Context Index\n\n### Overall Purpose\nSupabase is an open-source Firebase alternative offering a suite of backend tools built primarily on PostgreSQL. It provides developers with a managed Postgres database, Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Realtime subscriptions, Storage, and Vector embeddings (via pgvector) accessible through client libraries for various platforms and direct SQL interaction.\n\n### Core Concepts & Capabilities\n*   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Leverages PostgreSQL as its core. Supports standard SQL, database functions (`CREATE FUNCTION`), triggers (`CREATE TRIGGER`), and extensions (`CREATE EXTENSION`). Key extensions include `pgvector` for AI/vector operations and `pg_stat_statements` for query analysis. Common tables include `auth.users` and user-defined tables (e.g., `profiles`, `documents`).\n*   **Authentication:** Provides robust user management (`auth.users`) and authentication flows. Supports email/password, OAuth providers (e.g., Spotify), Magic Links/OTP (`signInWithOtp`), and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Managed via `supabase.auth` client methods and integrated with database security via RLS. Includes UI components like `@supabase/auth-ui-react`.\n*   **Authorization (Row Level Security - RLS):** Relies heavily on PostgreSQL's RLS (`CREATE POLICY`, `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`). Enables fine-grained data access control based on user identity (via `auth.uid()`) or JWT claims (via `auth.jwt() ->> 'claim'`). Policies define `USING` (read) and `WITH CHECK` (write) conditions.\n*   **Client Libraries & SDKs:** Offers official libraries for JavaScript/TypeScript (`supabase-js`), Python (`supabase-py`), Dart (`supabase-dart`), Swift (`supabase-swift`), Kotlin (`supabase-kt`). Provide idiomatic interfaces for Database CRUD (`from().select()`, `.insert()`, `.update()`, `.delete()`), function calls (`.rpc()`), Auth, Realtime, and Storage. Framework-specific helpers (e.g., `@supabase/ssr`, `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`) simplify integration.\n*   **Vector Search (pgvector):** Integrates the `pgvector` PostgreSQL extension for AI applications. Supports storing `vector` data types, creating similarity search indexes (`USING ivfflat/hnsw` with `vector_l2_ops`, `vector_ip_ops`, `vector_cosine_ops`), and querying via SQL or client libraries.\n*   **Realtime:** Broadcasts database changes (inserts, updates, deletes) and custom events over WebSockets. Clients subscribe to channels (`client.channel('topic').subscribe(...)`) to receive updates.\n*   **Framework Integration:** Provides tools and guides for integration with frameworks like Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, Angular etc., often including helpers for server-side rendering (SSR) and authentication management (e.g., middleware, cookie handling).\n*   **CLI:** `supabase` CLI tool for local development (`init`, `start`, `db push`), managing migrations, and interacting with the Supabase platform.\n\n### Key APIs / Components / Configuration / Patterns\n*   `create extension vector with schema extensions;`: SQL command to enable pgvector.\n*   `supabase.auth.signInWith...({ provider?, email?, password?, phone?, options? })`: JS client: Core methods for user login (OAuth, OTP, Password, Phone).\n*   `supabase.auth.signUp({ email?, password?, phone?, options? })`: JS client: Method for user registration.\n*   `supabase.auth.getSession()` / `supabase.auth.getUser()`: JS client: Retrieve current user session/details.\n*   `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => ...)`: JS client: Listener for authentication state changes (SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT, etc.).\n*   `create policy \\\"name\\\" on table for {SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE} using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id )`: Common RLS pattern for user-specific data access.\n*   `auth.uid()`: SQL function: Returns the UUID of the currently authenticated user (essential for RLS).\n*   `auth.jwt()`: SQL function: Returns the JWT claims of the current user (useful for role/MFA checks in RLS, e.g., `auth.jwt() ->> 'aal'`).\n*   `supabase.from('table_name').select('columns')`: JS client: Basic data retrieval. Supports filtering, ordering, limiting.\n*   `supabase.from('table_name').insert([{ col: val }, ...])`: JS client: Data insertion.\n*   `supabase.rpc('function_name', { arg1: val })`: JS client: Call a PostgreSQL database function.\n*   `supabase.channel('channel_name').on(...).subscribe(...)`: JS client: Subscribe to Realtime broadcasts/DB changes.\n*   `createClient<Database>(url, key)`: JS/TS client: Initialize the Supabase client, optionally with generated TypeScript types for enhanced safety.\n*   `createServerClient()` / `createMiddlewareClient()`: JS/TS client: Specialized helpers for server-side (e.g., Next.js API routes, middleware) authentication and session handling.\n*   `.textSearch('column', 'query', { type?, config? })`: JS client: Perform full-text search using `to_tsvector` and `to_tsquery`.\n*   `vector(dimensions)`: SQL data type for storing vector embeddings (from pgvector).\n*   `create index ... using ivfflat (column vector_ip_ops) with (lists = N);`: SQL example for creating a vector index (inner product).\n*   `supabase init`: CLI: Initialize Supabase configuration in a local project directory.\n*   `.env.local` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Common pattern for storing Supabase credentials as environment variables.\n*   `create function handle_new_user() returns trigger ... create trigger ... after insert on auth.users ...`: Common SQL pattern to automatically create related data (e.g., a user profile) when a new user signs up.\n\n### Common Patterns & Best Practices / Pitfalls\n*   **RLS is Default Security:** Always enable RLS on tables containing sensitive data (`alter table ... enable row level security;`) and define appropriate `create policy` statements. Default is denial.\n*   **Use `auth.uid()` for Ownership:** Base RLS policies on `auth.uid()` for user-specific data access.\n*   **Leverage `auth.jwt()` for Claims:** Use `auth.jwt()` to access custom claims or standard claims like `aal` (Assurance Level for MFA) within policies.\n*   **Server-Side Auth Handling:** Use framework-specific helpers (`createServerClient`, middleware) for correct session management in server environments (SSR, API routes).\n*   **Indexing:** Create standard PostgreSQL indexes (`create index`) on columns frequently used in RLS policy `WHERE` clauses or query filters (e.g., `user_id`, foreign keys) to optimize performance. Create vector indexes (`using ivfflat/hnsw`) for similarity searches.\n*   **Database Functions & Triggers:** Encapsulate business logic in SQL functions (`create function`) and automate actions using triggers (`create trigger`) for consistency and performance (e.g., creating profiles on signup).\n*   **Typed Client (TypeScript):** Generate database types (`supabase gen types typescript`) and use `createClient<Database>(...)` for improved type safety and developer experience.\n*   **Environment Variables:** Securely manage Supabase URL and API keys using environment variables. Distinguish between public (`NEXT_PUBLIC_...` or equivalent) and secret keys.\n*   **Restrictive Policies:** Use `as restrictive` policies carefully, as they can override permissive policies and deny access unexpectedly, especially useful for enforcing conditions like MFA (`using ((select auth.jwt()->>'aal') = 'aal2')`).\n\n---\nThis index summarizes the core concepts, APIs, and patterns for Supabase based on the provided snippets.
