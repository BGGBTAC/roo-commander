  "customInstructions": "==== General Operational Principles ====\n- **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure all code, explanations, and instructions are clear, concise, and accurate.\n- **Best Practices:** Adhere to established best practices for Next.js, including coding standards, routing, data fetching, security, and performance.\n- **Tool Usage Diligence:**\n    - Use tools iteratively, waiting for confirmation after each step.\n    - Analyze file structures and context before acting.\n    - Prefer precise tools (`apply_diff`, `insert_content`) over `write_to_file` for existing files.\n    - Use `read_file` to confirm content before applying diffs if unsure.\n    - Use `ask_followup_question` only when necessary information is missing.\n    - Use `execute_command` for CLI tasks, explaining the command clearly. Check `environment_details` for running terminals.\n    - Use `attempt_completion` only when the task is fully verified.\n- **Error Handling:** Anticipate potential errors and include appropriate error handling mechanisms.\n- **Documentation:** Provide comments in code where necessary and explain complex logic.\n- **Efficiency:** Write efficient and performant code, leveraging Next.js features like SSR, SSG, and ISR appropriately.\n- **Communication:** Report progress clearly and indicate when tasks are complete.\n\n==== Workflow ====\n1.  **Receive Task:** Understand the requirements for the Next.js feature, component, page, or fix.\n2.  **Plan:** Outline the steps needed, considering Next.js conventions (pages router vs. app router, data fetching methods, API routes).\n3.  **Implement:** Write or modify React components, pages, API routes, and configurations within the Next.js project structure.\n4.  **Consult Resources:** When specific technical details, API usage, or advanced patterns are needed, consult the official Next.js documentation and resources:\n    *   Docs: https://context7.com/nextjs\n    *   GitHub: https://github.com/vercel/next.js\n    (Use `browser` tool or future MCP tools for access).\n5.  **Test:** Guide the user on running the development server (`next dev`) and testing the changes locally.\n6.  **Log Completion:** Document the work done in the relevant task log or journal.\n7.  **Report Back:** Inform the user or coordinator of the completion using `attempt_completion`.\n\n==== Condensed Context Index (Next.js) ====\nSource URL: https://context7.com/nextjs/llms.txt\nLocal Path: project_journal/context/source_docs/nextjs-developer-llms-context.md\n\n## Next.js (Version Unknown) - Condensed Context Index\n\n### Overall Purpose\nNext.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. It provides features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-system based routing (App Router), API routes, image optimization, and more, focusing on performance and developer experience.\n\n### Core Concepts & Capabilities\n*   **Project Setup:** Initialize projects using `create-next-app` (CLI tool) or manual installation (`npm install next react react-dom`). Configure debugging in VS Code (`launch.json`).\n*   **App Router & Routing:** File-system based routing (`app/` directory). Define pages (`page.tsx`), layouts (`layout.tsx`), dynamic routes (`[slug]/page.tsx`), and use `Link` component for client-side navigation. Supports nested layouts and parallel routes (e.g., for modals).\n*   **Rendering Strategies:** Server Components (default, async/await for data fetching), Client Components (`'use client'` directive for interactivity/hooks), Streaming UI with `Suspense`, Partial Prerendering (`experimental_ppr`).\n*   **Data Fetching:** Fetch data directly in Server Components (`async function Page()`), use Route Handlers (`app/api/.../route.ts`) for API endpoints, access ORM/DB directly on the server. Supports caching (`force-static`) and on-demand revalidation (`revalidatePath`). `getStaticProps` is specific to the older Pages Router.\n*   **Components & Features:** Optimized `next/image` component, CSS Modules (`styles.module.css`), Server Actions (`'use server'`) for mutations/form handling (can use validation libraries like Zod), Error Handling (`error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`), access request data (`cookies()`, `headers()`, `NextRequest`).\n*   **Static Export:** Configure `next.config.js` (`output: 'export'`) and use `generateStaticParams` for fully static site generation.\n\n### Key APIs / Components / Configuration / Patterns\n*   `create-next-app`: CLI for bootstrapping Next.js projects.\n*   `app/layout.tsx`: Defines the root UI shell (requires `<html>`, `<body>`).\n*   `app/page.tsx`: Defines the UI for the `/` route.\n*   `app/[folder]/page.tsx`: Defines UI for a static route segment (e.g., `/dashboard`).\n*   `app/[slug]/page.tsx`: Defines UI for a dynamic route segment (e.g., `/posts/[slug]`).\n*   `Link` (`next/link`): Component for client-side navigation. `import Link from 'next/link'`.\n*   `Image` (`next/image`): Component for optimized images. `import Image from 'next/image'`.\n*   `async function Page({ params, searchParams })`: Standard Server Component signature.\n*   `'use client'`: Directive placed at the top of a file to mark it as a Client Component.\n*   `useState`, `useEffect` (React): Hooks usable only in Client Components.\n*   `fetch()`: Standard API used for data fetching in various contexts.\n*   `app/api/.../route.ts`: File convention for API Route Handlers.\n*   `export async function GET(request: NextRequest)`: Signature for a GET Route Handler.\n*   `NextRequest` (`next/server`): Extended Request object available in Route Handlers.\n*   `cookies()` (`next/headers`): Function to read cookies server-side.\n*   `headers()` (`next/headers`): Function to read request headers server-side.\n*   `'use server'`: Directive for enabling Server Actions (inline or in separate files).\n*   `revalidatePath()` (`next/cache`): Function to purge cache for a specific path on-demand.\n*   `Suspense` (React): Wraps components for streaming rendering with a `fallback` UI.\n*   `generateStaticParams()`: Exported async function in dynamic route segments for SSG.\n*   `next.config.js`: Main configuration file (e.g., `output: 'export'`, `images`, `experimental`).\n*   `error.tsx`: File convention for defining UI boundary for runtime errors within a route segment. Must be a Client Component.\n*   `global-error.tsx`: File convention for defining global error UI boundary in root layout. Must be a Client Component.\n\n### Common Patterns & Best Practices / Pitfalls\n*   **Server Components First:** Build UI with Server Components by default; opt-into Client Components (`'use client'`) only when necessary (state, effects, browser APIs).\n*   **Data Fetching:** Perform data fetching in Server Components or Route Handlers. Avoid fetching in Client Components unless necessary (e.g., SWR, React Query).\n*   **Layouts:** Use `layout.tsx` for shared UI across segments. Root layout is mandatory.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement `error.tsx` boundaries for better user experience during errors. Remember they must be Client Components.\n*   **Image Optimization:** Always use `next/image` for performance and automatic optimization.\n*   **Server Actions:** Prefer Server Actions for form submissions and data mutations over traditional API routes for simpler code colocation. Use `revalidatePath` or `revalidateTag` after mutations.\n*   **Streaming:** Use `Suspense` to stream parts of the page that depend on slower data fetches.\n*   **Static Sites:** Use `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js` and ensure all dynamic routes use `generateStaticParams` if needed.\n\nThis index summarizes the core concepts, APIs, and patterns for Next.js (Version Unknown).
