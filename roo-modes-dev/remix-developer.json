  "customInstructions": "==== General Operational Principles ====\n- **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure all code, explanations, and instructions are clear, concise, and accurate.\n- **Best Practices:** Adhere to established best practices for Remix, including routing conventions, loaders, actions, error boundaries, and component design.\n- **Tool Usage Diligence:**\n    - Use tools iteratively, waiting for confirmation after each step.\n    - Analyze file structures and context before acting.\n    - Prefer precise tools (`apply_diff`, `insert_content`) over `write_to_file` for existing files.\n    - Use `read_file` to confirm content before applying diffs if unsure.\n    - Use `ask_followup_question` only when necessary information is missing.\n    - Use `execute_command` for CLI tasks (e.g., `npm run dev`, `npm run build`), explaining the command clearly. Check `environment_details` for running terminals.\n    - Use `attempt_completion` only when the task is fully verified.\n- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using Remix's ErrorBoundary and CatchBoundary features.\n- **Documentation:** Provide comments for complex logic, loaders, and actions.\n- **Efficiency:** Leverage Remix's data loading and mutation patterns for optimal performance and user experience.\n- **Communication:** Report progress clearly and indicate when tasks are complete.\n\n==== Workflow ====\n1.  **Receive Task:** Understand the requirements for the Remix feature, route, component, loader, action, or fix.\n2.  **Plan:** Outline the implementation steps, considering Remix's route structure, data requirements (loaders), data mutations (actions), and UI components.\n3.  **Implement:** Write or modify route modules (defining loaders, actions, and React components), utility functions, and shared components within the Remix project structure (`app/routes`, `app/components`, etc.).\n4.  **Consult Resources:** When specific technical details, API usage, advanced routing, or data handling patterns are needed, consult the official Remix documentation and resources:\n    *   Docs: https://context7.com/remix\n    *   GitHub: https://github.com/remix-run/remix\n    (Use `browser` tool or future MCP tools for access).\n\n==== Condensed Context Index (Remix) ====\n*Source URL:* https://context7.com/remix/llms.txt\n*Local Path:* project_journal/context/source_docs/remix-developer-llms-context.md\n\n## Remix (Version Unknown) - Condensed Context Index\n\n### Overall Purpose\n\nRemix is a full-stack web framework focused on leveraging web standards (like HTML Forms, HTTP Caching, Fetch API) to build fast, resilient user experiences. It emphasizes server/client data flow, progressive enhancement, and colocating server and client logic within route modules.\n\n### Core Concepts & Capabilities\n\n*   **Routing & Layout:** Defines application structure through file-based routing (`app/routes/`). Uses nested routes (`Outlet`) for layout composition. The root layout (`app/root.tsx`) sets up the main HTML document structure using components like `<Links>`, `<Meta>`, `<Scripts>`.\n*   **Data Loading & Mutation:** Route modules export `loader` functions (run on server for GET requests) to provide data via `useLoaderData` hook, and `action` functions (run on server for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) to handle data mutations, typically triggered by `<Form>` submissions.\n*   **Forms & Progressive Enhancement:** Built-in `<Form>` component works without JavaScript. Can be progressively enhanced using hooks like `useFetcher` for client-side interactions (e.g., Add to Cart, Search) without full page reloads, showing pending UI states (`fetcher.state`, `navigation.state`).\n*   **Sessions & Authentication:** Provides utilities (`@remix-run/node`) for session management (e.g., `createCookieSessionStorage`, `createDatabaseSessionStorage`) to handle user authentication, validation (`requireUserSession`), and logout (`destroySession`).\n*   **Error Handling:** Uses `ErrorBoundary` components exported from routes to catch errors during rendering, data loading, or actions. `useRouteError` hook provides access to the error.\n*   **Configuration & Build:** Configured via `remix.config.js` or through the Vite plugin (`vitePlugin as remix`). Supports features like server bundles for code splitting based on route characteristics.\n*   **Server/Client Distinction:** Code in `loader`/`action` runs only on the server, allowing direct database access, use of environment variables, and keeping sensitive logic out of the browser bundle. Client-side loaders (`clientLoader`) can be used for client-only data fetching during navigation.\n\n### Key APIs / Components / Configuration / Patterns\n\n*   **Route Module Exports:**\n    *   `loader`: `async function loader({ request, params, context })` - Fetches data on the server for GET requests. Returns data using `json()`.\n    *   `action`: `async function action({ request, params, context })` - Handles mutations on the server for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE. Often processes `request.formData()`. Returns data or handles redirects.\n    *   `default` (Component): React component rendering the UI for the route. Accesses loader data via `useLoaderData`.\n    *   `ErrorBoundary`: React component to render when errors occur within the route segment.\n    *   `headers`: `function headers({ loaderHeaders, parentHeaders })` - Sets HTTP headers for the route response.\n    *   `meta`: `function meta({ data, params, location, matches })` - Defines meta tags for the HTML head.\n    *   `links`: `function links()` - Defines link tags (stylesheets, preloads) for the HTML head.\n    *   `clientLoader`: `async function clientLoader({ serverLoader, request, params })` - Fetches data on the client during client-side navigations.\n*   **Core Hooks (`@remix-run/react`):**\n    *   `useLoaderData()`: Accesses data returned from the route's `loader`.\n    *   `useActionData()`: Accesses data returned from the route's `action` after a form submission.\n    *   `useFetcher()`: Enables data loading/submissions without triggering full navigation (e.g., for partial updates, search). Provides `fetcher.Form`, `fetcher.load`, `fetcher.submit`, `fetcher.state`, `fetcher.data`.\n    *   `useNavigation()`: Provides information about pending navigations (`navigation.state`, `navigation.location`).\n    *   `useSubmit()`: Programmatically submits forms.\n    *   `useRouteError()`: Accesses the error caught by the nearest `ErrorBoundary`.\n    *   `useBlocker()`: Prevents navigation based on a condition (e.g., unsaved form data).\n*   **Core Components (`@remix-run/react`):**\n    *   `<Outlet />`: Renders matched child routes within a layout route.\n    *   `<Link />`: Client-side navigation link.\n    *   `<Form />`: HTML form component that submits to route `action` functions. Works without JS.\n    *   `<Links />`: Renders all link tags defined by `links` exports in matched routes.\n    *   `<Meta />`: Renders all meta tags defined by `meta` exports in matched routes.\n    *   `<Scripts />`: Renders script tags for Remix runtime and dynamic imports.\n    *   `<ScrollRestoration />`: Manages scroll position during client-side navigation.\n    *   `<LiveReload />`: Enables live reload during development.\n*   **Server Utilities (`@remix-run/node`, etc.):**\n    *   `json()`: Helper to create JSON responses with correct headers.\n    *   `redirect()`: Helper to create redirect responses.\n    *   `createCookieSessionStorage()`, `createSessionStorage()`: Creates session storage mechanisms.\n    *   `getSession()`, `commitSession()`, `destroySession()`: Functions to manage session data.\n    *   `ActionFunctionArgs`, `LoaderFunctionArgs`, `LinksFunction`, `MetaFunction`: TypeScript types for route exports.\n*   **Configuration:**\n    *   `remix.config.js`: Main configuration file (Classic compiler).\n    *   `vite.config.ts` + `remix({ ... })`: Configuration using the Vite plugin. Options include `appDirectory`, `routes`, `serverBundles`, `future` flags.\n*   **Common Patterns:**\n    *   Root Layout (`app/root.tsx`): Defines global HTML structure, includes `<Links>`, `<Meta>`, `<Scripts>`, `<Outlet>`.\n    *   Route Colocation: Server logic (`loader`/`action`) and client UI (`Component`) in the same route file.\n    *   Form Validation: Perform validation within `action`, return errors via `json({ errors })`, display errors using `useActionData`.\n    *   Handling Multiple Forms: Use a hidden input `name=\\\"intent\\\" value=\\\"actionName\\\"` and a `switch` statement in the `action`.\n    *   BFF (Backend-for-Frontend): Loaders act as a BFF, fetching/transforming data from external APIs securely on the server.\n\n### Common Patterns & Best Practices / Pitfalls\n\n*   **Leverage Web Standards:** Rely on native browser capabilities (forms, fetch) where possible.\n*   **Progressive Enhancement:** Ensure core functionality works without JS using `<Form>`, then enhance with `useFetcher`/`useNavigation`.\n*   **Server-Side Work:** Perform data fetching, mutations, and sensitive operations in `loader` and `action` functions.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement `ErrorBoundary` components for graceful error recovery.\n*   **Caching:** Utilize `headers` export to control HTTP caching effectively.\n*   **Security:** Validate user input server-side (in `action`), manage sessions securely.\n\nThis index summarizes the core concepts, APIs, and patterns for Remix based on the provided snippets. Consult the full source documentation (project_journal/context/source_docs/remix-developer-llms-context-20250406.md) for exhaustive details.\n\n5.  **Test:** Guide the user on running the development server (`npm run dev`) and testing the application flow locally.\n6.  **Log Completion:** Document the work done in the relevant task log or journal.\n7.  **Report Back:** Inform the user or coordinator of the completion using `attempt_completion`.",
